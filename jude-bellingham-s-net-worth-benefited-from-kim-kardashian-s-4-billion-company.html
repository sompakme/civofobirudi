Kardashian's fans have also been interested in <a href=#>how rich she is</a> because of how amazing her lifestyle looks from afar.</p><p>Even though <a href=#>Kardashian has been accused of being cheap</a>, it has been reported that even her employees like <a href=#>her private chef become rich</a>. It has also recently become clear that Jude Bellingham is becoming richer thanks to his involvement with Kardashian's $4 billion company.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>how Jude Bellingham became richer thanks to working with Kim Kardashian's Skims</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>how rich Jude Bellingham is</strong> according to public reporting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jude-bellingham-signed-an-endorsement-deal-with-kim-kardashian-39-s-skims-clothing-brand>Jude Bellingham Signed An Endorsement Deal With Kim Kardashian's Skims Clothing Brand</h2><p>In 2019, Kim Kardashian, Emma Grede, and Jens Grede co-founded Skims, a shapewear and clothing brand. Seemingly from the moment that the company was launched, it appeared to be poised for monster success. After all, millions of people see the appeal of clothing that can shape how their bodies look.</p><p>When Skims launched, the brand being associated with Kim Kardashian was more than enough to promote it to the company's early customers. Over time, however, the people behind Skims have been increasingly trying to promote the brand to men who weren't customers at first.</p><p>As a result of that new focus, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skims hired the superstar athlete Jude Bellingham to promote their clothing</a></strong> to male customers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jude-bellingham-in-uniform.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The way that Kardashian and Bellingham's association was revealed to both of their fans was brilliant. Seemingly out of nowhere a series of photos that Bellingham posed for in order to promote Skims were released to the public.</p><p>Before Jude Bellingham agreed to promote Skims, another superstar who is known for being in amazing shape worked with the brand. As The Hollywood Reporter revealed, the music superstar Usher promoted Skims before Bellingham did.</p><p>In those images, Bellingham could be <strong>seen only wearing Skims shapewear as he posed clutching a ball</strong>. Considering how incredibly fit Bellingham is as a professional athlete, there is no doubt that he made Skims shapewear look fantastic.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kim-kardashian-s-plastic-surgery-denial-is-legendary-but-here-s-why-she-admitted-to-getting-botox-in-her-neck.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Who Really Runs Kim Kardashian's Instagram Account?

Unfortunately, that figure hasn't been reported so there is no way for the public to know how much money Bellingham was paid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-kim-kardashian-try-to-bribe-the-mayor-of-l-a-_-here-s-the-truth-about-the-swag-bag-sent-from-skims.jpg><p>On the bright side, learning more about the situation will give fans <strong>an idea about how much money Bellingham was likely to be paid</strong>.</p><p>What are Kim Kardashian's most successful businesses, according to Glamour UK?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Company:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Rank</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Kardashian Kard</p></td><td><p>#13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kardashian Beauty</p></td><td><p>#12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Belle Noel Jewellery</p></td><td><p>#11</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Selfish</p></td><td><p>#10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kim Kardashian Hollywood!</p></td><td><p>#9</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ShoeDazzle</p></td><td><p>#8</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kim's first perfume</p></td><td><p>#7</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Skky Partners Private Equity</p></td><td><p>#6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dash Boutique</p></td><td><p>#5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Kimoji</p></td><td><p>#4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>KKW Beauty & SKKN</p></td><td><p>#3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>KKW Fragrance</p></td><td><p>#2</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Skims</p></td><td><p>#1</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One example of that is the fact that in July 2023, The New York Times reported that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the company Skims was valued at $4 billion</a></strong>.

Since Bellingham became an athletic superstar, several companies have made deals to associate themselves with him.</p><p>For example, <strong>Bellingham has made promotional deals with companies like Lucozade and Adidas</strong>. More importantly, there were reports about Bellingham being in negotiations to make a truly stunning deal with a major company in the past.</p><p>In December 2023, The Daily Mail reported that Bellingham was in serious negotiations to make a deal to promote Louis Vuitton.
