You can hope that this isn't a big deal, but for half our list there were some serious issues that came from their decision to lock lips.</p><p>We hope Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lawrence, and Angelina Jolie won't take it too personally when we put them on blast for things that their co-stars have said about their smooching abilities on the big screen.</p><p>Though guys aren't immune either, as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp have all had moments where their co-star definitely wasn't wanting to get too close. In fact, Depp was forced to chug Listerine prior to kissing Jolie!</p><p>Not every on-screen makeout is awkward though, and we have the quotes to prove that as well. Whether it's Amanda Seyfried gushing over Megan Fox, Radcliffe giving credit to Watson or the bond that Prepon and Schilling have created; below we have 8 co-stars who loved acting out some adult situations for the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---alyson-hannigan-hated-kissing-the-smoker-jason-segel><strong>Didn't Want To - Alyson Hannigan&nbsp;Hated Kissing The Smoker Jason Segel</strong></h2><p>How I Met Your Mother&nbsp;may have been a show about Ted's journey to meet his future wife, but along the way, audiences got to enjoy the exploits of him and his friends that included an iconic TV couple in Marshall and Lily.</p><p>However when <a href=#>Segel</a> and <a href=#>Hannigan</a> first met, she made it clear that things would have to be different if they wanted to be a couple that kisses on screen.</p><p>“She told me she would not do any romantic scenes with me as long as I was smoking. And that left me with no other option. So I quit the day we started working, and I haven’t had a cigarette since," said Segel in a past interview.</p><p>Looks like the show improved both his bank account and his health!</p><h2 id=excited---seyfried-thought-it-was-really-hot-to-kiss-fox><strong>Excited - Seyfried Thought&nbsp;It Was Really Hot To Kiss Fox</strong></h2><p>Even if you didn't have a huge interest in seeing the movie Jennifer's Body which starred <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> and <a href=#>Amanda Seyfried</a>, we wouldn't blame you if reading that they loved making out with each other in the movie causes you to put that at the top of your priority list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We kissed really well together. We have similar kissing styles! If I watch the scene, it’s actually really sexy," said Seyfried when talking about the scene.</p><p>Seyfried also locked lips with <a href=#>Julianne Moore</a> in the movie Chloe.</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---alec-baldwin-thought-aniston-was-painful><strong>Didn't Want To - Alec Baldwin Thought Aniston Was Painful</strong></h2><p>You wouldn't be the only person out there who thought that Rachel Green was the most beautiful sitcom star of all-time. So you'll be glad to hear that it's not <a href=#>LeBlanc</a> or <a href=#>Schwimmer</a> putting Aniston on blast for her kissing skills, but <a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a>!</p><p>Aniston enjoyed a brief stint on the series&nbsp;30 Rock,&nbsp;during which she got up close with Baldwin but when describing the moment, Baldwin said,</p><p>"It was painful, I mean, every man who’s had to make out with her in TV and movies – I don’t know how they do it.”</p><p>We're sure when you're thinking about parts of being an actor that suck, having to potentially kiss Jennifer Aniston didn't spring to your mind.</p><h2 id=excited---jolie-couldn-t-wait-to-kiss-elizabeth-mitchell><strong>Excited - Jolie Couldn't Wait To Kiss&nbsp;</strong><strong>Elizabeth Mitchell</strong></h2><p>Angelina Jolie may have been put on blast in this list for her terrible kissing skills by James McAvoy, but she was a lot more comfortable getting close to the beautiful Elizabeth Mitchell in the movie Gia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie admitted in an interview that she had lesbian relations in her real life, and when describing getting intimate with Mitchell said,</p><p>"I was looking forward to kissing and touching her, watching her discover love between women and hopefully enjoying it. I think she did. Anything that felt that good couldn't possibly be bad. I love women."</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---kirsten-dunst-thought-brad-pitt-was-disgusting><strong>Didn't Want To - Kirsten Dunst Thought Brad Pitt Was Disgusting</strong></h2><p>Now if we're going to be completely fair, <a href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a> may have a much different opinion if she got the chance to lock lips with Brad Pitt again now that she's older. But back when she was 11 years old, she starred in the movie&nbsp;Interview with a Vampire&nbsp;in which she got to kiss Brad Pitt (who was considerably older!).</p><p>“Everyone at the time was like, ‘You’re so lucky you kissed Brad Pitt,’ but I thought it was disgusting. I didn’t kiss anyone else until I was 16, I think. I was a late bloomer," said Dunst when describing the kiss.</p><p>We'd love to see the reaction of the guy who she kissed at 16, "Oh yeah, no biggie, I've only made out with Brad Pitt before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=excited---hudgens-prefers-kissing-women><strong>Excited - Hudgens Prefers Kissing Women</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a> has plenty of roles in which she embraces her clean Disney image, but when it came to breaking free from that she elected to go with the movie Spring Breakers.</p><p>While Hudgens doesn't bare it all in the movie, she does get plenty intimate with both <a href=#>James Franco</a> and <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a> (at the same time). But when describing the kissing, it was Benson who stood out to Hudgens.</p><p>"I was just happy I had Ashley [Benson] because I was like, 'Ugh, eww, I don't want to kiss James. ... I'd rather kiss a girl than a guy on camera," said Hudgens.</p><p>We're sure future casting directors will keep that in mind!</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---pattinson-had-a-runny-nose><strong>Didn't Want To - Pattinson Had A Runny Nose</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> had a significant age gap between he&nbsp;and <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> when the two were cast to play lovers in&nbsp;Water for Elephants.&nbsp;While that could make things awkward, Pattinson was determined to rock the makeout scene...except for the fact that he was super sick that day.</p><p>“My nose is running all over the place, and it was in one of the additional photography scenes, and Reese had this wig on, and literally, I was wiping my nose on her wig," said Pattinson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Witherspoon shockingly, also remembered that day on set saying in a past interview "He did have a very runny nose, yeah, It wasn’t appealing; it wasn’t pleasant.”</p><p>Take note people, sick isn't sexy!</p><h2 id=excited---zac-had-a-crush-on-heather-growing-up><strong>Excited - Zac Had A Crush On Heather Growing Up</strong></h2><p>Naturally, when you are a young and aspiring actor, there is no shortage of people in the industry in which you look up to (or fantasize about). For <a href=#>Zac Efron</a>, one of the most tantalizing women was <a href=#>Heather Graham</a>. Though to be fair, Graham does have quite a few&nbsp;roles in which she bares it all and gets herself into very adult situations.</p><p>When Efron got the chance to star with Graham in the movie At Any Price, including a love scene, he was open about his excitement,</p><p>"I was nervous because I've been in love with her since I can remember. It was very surreal for me."</p><p>We're sure this isn't the only example of one co-star getting to make out with someone they idolized.</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---hemsworth-said-lawrence-tasted-like-garlic-and-tuna><strong>Didn't Want To - Hemsworth Said Lawrence Tasted Like Garlic And Tuna</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Liam Hemsworth</a> may not have been as big a star as <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> in&nbsp;The Hunger Games&nbsp;franchise, but he was still an integral part&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>he got to kiss Jennifer Lawrence, so we're sure there are at least a few jealous guys out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet when Hemsworth opened up about the intimate moments, he made sure to put her on blast for her bad breath,</p><p>"Anytime I had to kiss Jennifer was pretty uncomfortable, when you look at it on the outside, it looks like a great picture. She’s one of my best friends. I love her. But if we had a kissing scene, she would make a point of eating garlic or tuna fish or something that was disgusting.”</p><p>At least it sounds like Lawrence was doing it intentionally!</p><h2 id=excited---daniel-radcliffe-said-watson-kissed-like-an-animal-in-a-good-way><strong>Excited - Daniel Radcliffe Said&nbsp;Watson Kissed Like An Animal (In A Good Way)</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe</a> was asked how he thought it would be to lock lips with <a href=#>Emma Watson</a> in the Harry Potter series, he responded that he thought it would be a nice soft and tender embrace.</p><p>However, when describing the kiss, Radcliffe was open about how into it Watson got,</p><p>"It was this very vigorous kissing scene. She really went for it, I have to say. It caught me slightly off guard, but yeah, I'm not complaining. Many men would lose a limb to be in that position, so I was absolutely fine with it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The director David Yates opened up about the intimate scene as well, saying "That was mainly Emma, I have to say," leading Watson to say,</p><p>"I guess I just realized that I would have fewer takes to do if I just got on with it and just gave David what he wanted, which was a passionate kiss."</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---depp-was-forced-to-chug-listerine><strong>Didn't Want To - Depp Was Forced To Chug Listerine</strong></h2><p>This list has no shortage of variety when it comes to stars, but one of the funniest examples involves two of the biggest stars in the world:&nbsp;<a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>.</p><p>The two were lovers in the movie The Tourist, but it was reported that Jolie took some serious issue to Depp's unpleasant odor and required him to have breath mints on a regular basis, including when dining with Pitt and Jolie.</p><p>The reports go as far as to suggest that Jolie required Depp to have Listerine before every kissing scene!</p><h2 id=excited---married-in-real-life-had-less-boundaries-on-set><strong>Excited - Married In Real Life, Had Less Boundaries On-Set</strong></h2><p>You better hope that <a href=#>Anna Paquin</a> had no issues getting up close and personal with Stephen Moyer in the television series&nbsp;True Blood.&nbsp;After all, the two met during the filming of the pilot and have since gone on to get married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When describing love scenes with <a href=#>Moyer</a>, Paquin said "Maybe it should be weird, simulating sex with your husband in front of people? But it's really not. When it's a love scene with someone you actually love, there's no feeling like, 'Can I touch him here? Can I touch him there?' You know what your boundaries are — or what they aren't, I suppose."</p><p>We're sure their close bond created a very fun set to be on.</p><h2 id=didn-t-want-to---james-mcavoy-thought-jolie-was-awkward-and-sweaty><strong>Didn't Want To - James McAvoy Thought Jolie Was Awkward And Sweaty</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> may have been comfortable stripping down in the movie Wanted (...though she used a body double, sorry fellas) but one of the steamiest moments of the film for <a href=#>James McAvoy</a> came when he got to lock lips with the former Mrs. Pitt.</p><p>However, when describing the kiss, it definitely didn't sound like it was the sexiest of moments describing it in a past interview,</p><p>"I can tell you what it was like to kiss her on a film set: awkward, sweaty and not very nice."</p><p>We're sure Jolie is a much&nbsp;better kisser without the camera crew standing by!</p><h2 id=excited---both-laura-and-taylor-were-comfortable-together><strong>Excited - Both Laura And Taylor&nbsp;Were Comfortable Together</strong></h2><p>Both <a href=#>Laura </a>and Taylor had to be well-aware that there were going to be some very adult situations when it came to their starring roles in&nbsp;Orange is the New Black.&nbsp;In fact, the first scene the two shot together featured them being naked and making out in a shower.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully both actresses have been open about their love and natural chemistry with one another as evident by this interview with Prepon,</p><p>"Luckily, we were totally comfortable with each other and had chemistry right away. We literally did one take of that, and she looked at me and was like, 'Thank god it’s you.' I’m like, 'Girl, thank god it’s you.'&nbsp;Because we were so comfortable." She&nbsp;went on to also say,</p><p>"It started out like, 'OK, Taylor, my hands are going to be here and my hands are going to be up on here,' and she’s like, 'OK, cool.' And then as the season went by, I’m like, 'OK, my hands are going to be like here' and she’s like, 'Put your hands wherever you want. I trust you, it doesn’t matter.'”</p><p>We're sure that comfort was vital considering the shower scene was far from the last time they explored each other's bodies.</p><h2 id=excited---henry-cavill-accidentally-became-the-man-of-steel-during-a-scene><strong>Excited - Henry Cavill Accidentally Became "The Man Of Steel" During A Scene</strong></h2><p>When it comes to this entry, we're afraid that we aren't too sure who the lovely lass was that made <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> truly become the "man of steel" on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We do however have a hilarious quote from him from when he talked to Men's Health when he described the situation,</p><p>“A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts, and I hadn’t rearranged my - stuff into a harmless position. She’s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard. I had to apologize profusely afterward. It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?
