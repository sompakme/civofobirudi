The actor also likes to showcase his relationship with his children from time to time.

But how close is the actor to Suri Cruise, his shared daughter with Katie Holmes? Well, over the years, the media has speculated what Cruise’s relationship with Suri is like. However, Holmes has called them out for their ‘inaccuracies’ on more than one occasion and has instead revealed what her daughter’s relationship with the actor is really like.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes Allowed Suri To Drink Starbucks Coffee As A 4-Year-Old</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-katie-holmes-39-relationship-timeline>Tom Cruise And Katie Holmes' Relationship Timeline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/katie-and-tom.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were first linked together in 2005 when the pair looked rather cozy on a trip to Europe together. That same year, Cruise went wild on an interview with Oprah and, while jumping up and down, discussed his relationship with the Dawson’s Creek star for the first time. "I'm in love. I'm in love and it's one of those things where you want to be cool, like, ‘Yeah I like her,'" he told the TV host. "That's not how I feel. I wanted to meet this person and I met her and she's extraordinary."</p><p>Cruise and Holmes got engaged in 2005 after only a couple of months of dating. A year later, the two welcomed their first and only daughter together, Suri Cruise. In 2006, the pair finally tied the knot with a lavish wedding at the Odescalchi Castle in Italy. In 2010, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Holmes told Marie Claire</a> that her marriage with Cruise was "inspiring and fun." Adding that, "It's an amazing life, but we always remind ourselves of how incredibly lucky we are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tom Cruise Set The Record Straight On If He Banned Katie Holmes From Taking Drugs During Her Pregnancy Delivery</a></span></p><p>While their marriage seemed to be doing great in front of the cameras, things weren’t so great at home. Because in 2012, Holmes decided to divorce the Mission: Impossible actor.</p><p>"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy," read a statement issued by Cruise’s reps.

Other sources claim that Suri “does not go to see his movies and he has no part in her life.”</p><p>An article in the Daily Mail even quoted a source close to Holmes who claimed that “While Katie is taking an active role in helping her daughter with college applications, the teen's father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mission Impossible star Tom, 60, will not play a role in the process</a> - having been estranged from his daughter since 2013, one year after he and Katie divorced.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Suri Cruise Really Feels About Her Father Tom Cruise Not Being In Her Life Anymore?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shortly after this article was published, these new rumors of Tom Cruise and his daughter went viral. But the Dawson’s Creek star quickly shot them down, claiming that they were very inaccurate. Although Holmes didn’t elaborate on what her daughter’s relationship with Cruise is actually like, this is the first time in over a decade that the actress has openly talked about their relationship.</p><p>Fans couldn’t help to notice how odd it is that Holmes defended the Mission: Impossible actor as a father to Suri so shortly after it was rumored that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cruise quit Scientology because it kept him away from his daughter</a>.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-has-paid-4-8-million-in-child-support-for-his-and-katie-holmes-39-daughter-suri>Tom Cruise Has Paid $4.8 Million in Child Support for His and Katie Holmes' Daughter, Suri</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fq9jrzaxmae0zll.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the Daily Mail, “Tom Cruise has always maintained his responsibilities when it comes to financial obligations to Katie and Suri.” This includes covering anything that Suri might need, including "medical, dental, insurance, education, college and other extracurricular costs."</p><p>This hasn’t been cheap to the Mission: Impossible actor. In fact, it’s estimated that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cruise has paid over $4.8 million in child support</a> since his divorce from Holmes. According to reports, Cruise has paid Holmes $400,000 a year in child support since 2012, which comes to $33,333.33 a month.</p><p>However, Cruises’s child support payments are about to stop since Suri turning 18 soon. Only time will tell if Suri will choose to have a closer relationship with her father moving forward. For her part, Holmes has admitted that she’ll support whatever decision her daughter makes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqyZmnqpu8umnKxlk6S6rrHNrapmp55itq%2Btwpysq5mTnrK0ecCbpq6sXam8rnnCq6yiq5WoerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIywoK2gXajCs7WO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html&text=Katie%20Holmes%20Took%20A%20Jab%20At%20The%20Media%20For%20Their%20%27Inaccuracies%27%20When%20Writing%20About%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Relati&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html&title=Katie%20Holmes%20Took%20A%20Jab%20At%20The%20Media%20For%20Their%20%27Inaccuracies%27%20When%20Writing%20About%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Relati" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html&title=Katie%20Holmes%20Took%20A%20Jab%20At%20The%20Media%20For%20Their%20%27Inaccuracies%27%20When%20Writing%20About%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Relati" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html&title=Katie%20Holmes%20Took%20A%20Jab%20At%20The%20Media%20For%20Their%20%27Inaccuracies%27%20When%20Writing%20About%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Relati" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkatie-holmes-took-a-jab-at-the-media-for-their-inaccuracies-when-writing-about-tom-cruise-s-relati.html&description=Katie%20Holmes%20Took%20A%20Jab%20At%20The%20Media%20For%20Their%20%27Inaccuracies%27%20When%20Writing%20About%20Tom%20Cruise%27s%20Relati" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kivan%C3%A7-tatlitug-girlfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kivan Tatlitug: Girlfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-krasinski-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Krasinski News - Us Weekly">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
