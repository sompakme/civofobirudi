In fact, the two just had shows in September 2023 with their band, Escape Artist Lovers. Rain also launched a podcast, 'Launch Left'.</p><p>Liberty Phoenix continues to work with the River Phoenix Center, helping behind the scenes rather than being in front of the camera or the center of attention.</p><h2 id=the-phoenix-family-went-through-some-strange-things>The Phoenix Family Went Through Some Strange Things</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/spl7557519_001.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Phoenix family was originally the Bottom family. John and Arlyn Bottom were hippies. They met when John decided to pick Arlyn up as a hitchhiker, and the pair married just a year later. Then they started their lives as nomads.</p><p>The couple started having kids as they traveled. Each of their five kids was born in a different state, a territory, and a different country. They had River, born in Oregon in 1970, and then two years later, they had their first daughter, Rain Phoenix in Texas. Then came Joaquin in Puerto Rico, Liberty Phoenix, who was born in Venezuela in 1976, and lastly, came Summer Phoenix who was born in Florida.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Vanessa Kirby And Joaquin Phoenix Took Their Method Acting To Another Dark Level During Napoleon</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">After Summer was born in 1979, the family changed its last name to Phoenix</a> because they'd recently risen out of the ashes after escaping from a dangerous cult that called themselves the Children of God.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When they escaped the cult, the family was in poverty.

She was even featured with her brothers in Teen Beat magazine.</p><p>It wasn't until Joaquin returned to acting, following the death of their brother (they were both there when he died), that Rain co-starred with her brother in To Die For... well sort of. She's an uncredited tambourine player, but at least she got to be there to support her brother in his return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After To Die For, Rain appeared in films like O and Will Smith's Hitch.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Does Joaquin Phoenix Dislike Jimmy Fallon?

They were together for four years, released four albums, and toured.</p><p>Later on, Rain formed the less gimmicky band called Papercranes, in 2004. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">So far they have released four albums and sometimes her sisters accompany the band</a>. Some other members that have come and gone include Red Hot Chili Peppers' bassist Flea, their original drummer Jack Irons, one of River's co-stars, Dermot Mulroney, and R.E.M.'s Scott McCaughey, who met Rain when she appeared in R.E.M.'s video short, At My Most Beautiful in 1999.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rain lives just a couple of houses down from her brother and does charity work with him.</p><h2 id=liberty-phoenix-doesn-39-t-act-anymore-either>Liberty Phoenix Doesn't Act Anymore Either</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar46736347-1.jpg><p>Liberty didn't take to acting as well as her three oldest siblings.

She also works in fashion.</p><p>The middle Phoenix child opened up her own store with the help of Summer, called Some Odd Rubies.

She's appeared in mostly television movies and her last project was in 2018. Summer's also been a model and a designer.</p><p>In 2003, Summer got engaged to Casey Affleck, her brother Joaquin's long-time friend. She gave birth to their first son, Indiana August in 2004, and then the pair married in 2006. Their second son, Atticus was born in 2008.</p><p>The pair separated in 2015 and later on in 2017, Summer filed for divorce.
