As one of the most versatile actresses in the industry, Thurman has set the bar high when it comes to acting. She is cherished and well-known for plenty of iconic roles and incredible performances in movies like Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill volumes 1 & 2 amongst many others.&nbsp;Moreover, the box office successes tied to Uma Thurman's movies have made her one of the most sought-out actresses in Hollywood.&nbsp; As such it may be fair to assume&nbsp;box-office friendly&nbsp;actors and actresses&nbsp;commonly&nbsp;encourage studios to spend big bucks on movie productions.</p><p>To&nbsp;further explore this statement, let us take a look at the 10 most expensive films wherein the renowned actress Uma Thurman has starred. Please note that this&nbsp;list is ranked in order and the majority of the data was gathered from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Films Leonardo Dicaprio Ever Starred In (& How Much They Made)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prime-22m>Prime ($22M)</h2><p>This 2005 romantic comedy involved quite the starstudded cast; Meryl Streep, Bryan Greenberg and of course, Uma Thurman.&nbsp;This tale about a New York-based career woman attempting to get back on her feet following a recent divorce has Thurman play the main character, Raffaela "Rafi" Gardet.</p><p>The movie was a box office hit which resulted in roughly $67M in box office sales. The latter hints at a film well received by the audience considering its production cost of only $22 million dollars.</p><h2 id=kill-bill-volume-1-amp-2-30m>Kill Bill: Volume 1 & 2 ($30M)</h2><p>These Quentin Tarantino directed films&nbsp;were extremely well received and became what many consider to be Hollywood classics. In&nbsp;Kill Bill&nbsp;volumes I and II, we find&nbsp;Uma Thurman as the star of the film: a wronged bride who swears revenge upon her enemies after waking up from a lengthy coma.</p><p>The martial arts filmed, helmed as an homage to grindhouse cinema, is one of Thurman's most successful films to date and only took $30M to make. Such a fact is impressive considering the tasteful direction and cinematic effects present in the film. It is no surprise that both films combined resulted in over $300M in box office worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gattaca-36m>Gattaca ($36M)</h2><p>Gattaca&nbsp;is one of Uma Thurma's earlier movies and tells the story of a futuristic society where genius children are conceived via a eugenics-based technology. The film finds our main character experiencing genetic discrimination from being conceived outside of the aforementioned practice.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;10 Of The Most Expensive Animated Movies Disney Has Made Thus Far</a></span></p><p>Herein, Thurman plays the role of Irene Cassini, the main character's coworker with whom he later falls in love with. The science fiction film was, unfortunately, a box-office flop with only $12.5 million dollars in sales despite&nbsp;accruing $35M in production cost.</p><h2 id=the-producers-45m>The Producers ($45M)</h2><p>In The Producers,&nbsp;we find Uma Thurma playing the role of a sultry-voiced seductress with more than one tricks up her sleeve. The musical comedy film, based on a broadway musical of the same name, was released back in 2005.</p><p>The critical reception of the film was subpar and despite its $45M price tag, the film only garnered $38.1 million dollars in the box office.</p><h2 id=be-cool-53m>Be Cool ($53M)</h2><p>The crime-comedy film&nbsp;Be Cool is yet another successful film starring the legendary actress. This time, we are looking at a budget of $53 million dollars which was well invested following a resulting box office of $95.2 million dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Back In My Day: 10 Most Expensive Period Piece Movies Of All Time (& How Much They Cost)</a></span></p><p>As seen in several other Uma Thurman films, the movie also has a starstudded cast including actors John Travolta, Vince Vaughn, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and actresses Christina Milian.</p><h2 id=playing-for-keeps-55m>Playing For Keeps ($55M)</h2><p>This romantic comedy directed by Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happiness and The Last Kiss) also cost a pretty penny to make and starred Uma Thurman. Other notable actors can be found within the cast such as Jessica Biel, Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones.</p><p>The movie's price tag was estimated at $55 million dollars yet only grossed $27.8 million dollars in box office sales. The latter made it a box office bomb.</p><h2 id=the-avengers-60m>The Avengers ($60M)</h2><p>Just in case you were wondering, Uma Thurman did not secretly star in the popular Marvel movie franchise we have grown to love today. In&nbsp;the 1998 film&nbsp;The Avengers Uma Thurman stars along with Ralph Fiennes as secret spies whose mission is to defeat a mad scientist with plans of world domination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film received negative reviews and was considered as being one of the worst films ever made. Its price tag clocked in at $60M and only grossed $48.6 million dollars in box office sales.</p><h2 id=paycheck-61m>Paycheck ($61M)</h2><p>This science fiction and action film directed by John Woo was much more successful than the previously mentioned entries in this list. In&nbsp;Paycheck Uma Thurman stars as a witty biologist and love interest to the main character played by Ben Affleck.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Stars Who Hate Their Iconic Roles</a></span></p><p>Herein, the two cross paths as Affleck's character&nbsp;is unraveling the puzzle underlying why he is being chased by a menacing threat. The film grossed $96 million dollars in box office sales&nbsp;against production costs of $61 million.</p><h2 id=percy-jackson-amp-the-olympians-the-lightning-thief-95m>Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief ($95M)</h2><p>This&nbsp;popular film remains one of Thurman's most pricey movies thus far. The action fantasy film based on the novel of the same name was a box office hit upon its release in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Herein, Uma Thurman stars as the well-known Greek figure "Medusa." Although her role was not central in this movie, she was still part of a successful production. The movie resulted in a box office of $226.4 million dollars against production costs of $95M.</p><h2 id=batman-amp-robin-160m>Batman & Robin ($160M)</h2><p>The 1997 rendition of Batman & Robin appears to be Uma Thurman's most expensive film to date. As the fourth and final installment in the 90s Batman film series, we find Uma Thurman playing the role of a villain: Poison Ivy.&nbsp;Our titular characters&nbsp;attempt to defeat Thurman's character and her accomplice, Mr. Freeze, from freezing all of mankind to death.</p><p>The movie had quite the starstudded cast from George Clooney to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Its production cost total at $160 million dollars. Though that did not cause much of an issue at the time as the movie did well at the box office with $238.2 million dollars in sales.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Highest-Grossing Scarlett Johansson Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9SmmGasmKq%2Frq3NZpyxqJWjwKrCxGakqK6ZmsBuuc6nnLJlnZaxpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html&text=The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Films%20Uma%20Thurman%20Ever%20Starred%20In%20%28%26amp%3b%20How%20Much%20They%20Made%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html&title=The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Films%20Uma%20Thurman%20Ever%20Starred%20In%20%28%26amp%3b%20How%20Much%20They%20Made%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html&title=The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Films%20Uma%20Thurman%20Ever%20Starred%20In%20%28%26amp%3b%20How%20Much%20They%20Made%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html&title=The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Films%20Uma%20Thurman%20Ever%20Starred%20In%20%28%26amp%3b%20How%20Much%20They%20Made%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-most-expensive-films-uma-thurman-ever-starred-in-how-much-they-made.html&description=The%2010%20Most%20Expensive%20Films%20Uma%20Thurman%20Ever%20Starred%20In%20%28%26amp%3b%20How%20Much%20They%20Made%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-she-say-shaunie-o-neal-that-s-kind-of-sexy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What She Say?
