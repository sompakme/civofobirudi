However, Spears herself recently shared details of that first meeting, which surprised many. It was also confusing to some, as Spears once seemed to forget ever meeting Swift during an interview.</p><p>Swift has a lot of respect for Spears, having written a song which many believe is about the pop princess.

It was backstage at the singer's "Oops!...I Did It Again World Tour" in 2000.</p><p>"This is way back when but kinda cool," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spears wrote</a>. "During my Oops Tour, I got a knock at my door. My good friend at the time was the assistant to my manager who was trying to become a manager himself.

She was asked to choose between Swift and Katy Perry. Spears' response sent the internet into meltdown mode.</p><p>"I don’t know! I don’t know, that’s hard. They’re both so cool, I don’t know," Spears said. "I’ve briefly met Katy Perry at the Smurfs movie premiere. Maybe because I’ve met Katy Perry, I would say Taylor Swift because I’ve never met her before."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar47150368.jpg><p>Spears was asked to choose between Swift and Perry due to their public feud during that time.

Swift added. "It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational—you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So, now I have to avoid her. It's awkward, and I don't like it."</p><p>Swift and Perry eventually buried the hatchet by reuniting in the "You Need To Calm Down" music video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=many-believe-taylor-referenced-britney-in-one-of-the-songs-on-her-39-red-39-album>Many Believe Taylor Referenced Britney In One Of The Songs On Her 'Red' Album</h2><p>In 2000, Spears released her sophomore album "Oops!...I Did It Again." The album's second single, "Lucky," was another huge hit. The song talks about a fictional Hollywood star who, despite her fame and success, cries at night because she is so unhappy.</p><p>"And they say/She’s so lucky/She’s a star/But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking/If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night," Spears sings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar51920009-1.jpg><p>As years went on and Spears' own personal troubles played out in the media, many attributed the song to be about the pop star herself.
