After testifying against former associates, he was released and lived under the cover of the United States witness protection program until his death in 2021.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Alpo Martinez Mother & Father: Are His Parents Still Alive?">Alpo Martinez Mother & Father: Are His Parents Still Alive?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Alpo Martinez Sister And Family Details">Alpo Martinez Sister And Family Details</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alpo-martinez-mother-father-are-his-parents-still-alive></span>Alpo Martinez Mother & Father: Are His Parents Still Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alpo was raised by a single mother after his father left the family.</p><p>There have been stories concerning Alpo’s parents, with some claiming that they are still living and others claiming that they are no longer alive, but no real information about their lives has been released.</p><p>The drug dealer, Alpo was one of two children raised by his single mother in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of East Harlem which was also known as Spanish Harlem. Before quitting out during his sophomore year, he attended a Roman Catholic school, Automotive Mechanical High School, and Julia Richmond High School.</p><p>Alpo began selling narcotics in East Harlem when he was 13 years old.</p><p>Martinez started moving up the chain of drug sellers in Harlem after meeting West Side Harlem drug dealer Azie Faison. He eventually became one of the city’s largest drug dealers.</p><p>He eventually relocated to Washington, D.C. to extend his operations, where he swiftly became entangled in the city’s underbelly and ramped up his drug dealing. Wayne Silk Perry, a reputed gangster, and D.C. enforcer became his bodyguard and hitman after meeting him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alpo-martinez-sister-and-family-details></span>Alpo Martinez Sister And Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alpo Martinez has a sibling in his family but hasn’t revealed if it’s a brother or sister.
