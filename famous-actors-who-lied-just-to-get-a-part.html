Almost everyone can say they’ve lied in an interview or on a resume to get a job before, so why should the world expect that Hollywood would be any different? When people know they want something, nothing will hold them back from getting that role, even if that involves having to deliver on a promise that wasn’t quite honest. These celebrities proved that sometimes stretching the truth can be beneficial, even if the lie will eventually come out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chlo-euml-grace-moretz-pulled-one-over-on-scorsese><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chloë Grace Moretz Pulled One Over On Scorsese</span></h2><p>Martin Scorsese’s name has long been associated with Hollywood hits, so it’s no wonder that upon hearing of his venture into the children’s film Hugo, Chloë Grace Moretz felt the need to do whatever she had to in order to get the role. When the casting call specified the search for British children, Moretz refused to bend and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">entered her audition with a solid British accent</a>. Staying in character until the end, she convinced Scorsese of her accent and got the role.</p><h2 id=laura-fraser-stretched-the-truth-ein-bisschen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Laura Fraser Stretched The Truth Ein Bisschen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before she was stealing the screen as the sleek black-marketeer Lydia Rodarte-Quayle on Breaking Bad, Laura Fraser was testing her acting skills in the best way – by lying at an audition. When studio heads approached her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asking about her knowledge of German</a>, the Scottish actress smiled and told them she was covered. Admittedly, she had learned some German but knew only a few phrases from her time in school. The truth came out after casting and filming, but she still got the part down.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Did 'Breaking Bad' Come To Being Cancelled?</a></span></p><h2 id=ceyair-wright-played-games-with-the-casting-director><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ceyair Wright Played Games With The Casting Director</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to sports and games, Ceyair Wright tends to be confident in his skills. Playing a wide variety of sports, the actor understands how to best show off his abilities whether on the screen or on the court. The one exception? He doesn’t play basketball. That didn’t stop Wright from responding with a positive when the casting director of Space Jam: A New Legacy asked. Wright landed the role and took to the court to practice like crazy before filming.</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-switched-up-for-success><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Robert Pattinson Switched Up For Success</span></h2><p>Who hasn’t bolstered a resume before? Prior to his <a href=#>Twilight and Harry Potter days</a>, Robert Pattinson found himself with no other choice due to the lack of experience to his name. The Batman actor claimed to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art as well as Oxford University just to impress. If that’s not enough, he even took to switching up to an American accent in auditions that he felt were crowded by the British population.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-mcadams-didn-rsquo-t-horse-around><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rachel McAdams Didn’t Horse Around</span></h2><p>No one can claim Rachel McAdams isn’t dedicated to her craft. When the opportunity to work with director Terrance Malick came up, she jumped at the chance to read for Jane in To The Wonder. To ensure she’d be properly prepared for all aspects of the role, she was asked whether she liked horses and working with them. McAdams cheerfully agreed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not mentioning her fear and the fact that she was allergic</a> to the animal. She doped up on allergy meds and worked through the fear to get the job done.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Many Charitable Causes That Rachel McAdams Supports</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mescal-drove-by-a-requirement><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Paul Mescal Drove By A Requirement</span></h2><p>After hearing that Sally Rooney’s hit novel Normal People was taking to the screen, <a href=#>Paul Mescal and his agent knew that the part was made for him</a>. There was only one problem – the role required a lot of screen time behind the wheel of a car and Mescal didn’t have a license. His agent lied to the casting director prior to the audition and told Mescal to do everything he could to streamline getting that license before the role.</p><h2 id=morgan-freeman-showed-some-silence><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Morgan Freeman Showed Some Silence</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how big the star status is, sometimes there’s no getting around stretching the truth to get what you want. Called into the cast of Oblivion for his iconic voice, Morgan Freeman wanted to be involved as more than just the narrator. Pushing to see how far he could go (and to see how much he was wanted), the actor faked an issue with his throat, claiming he couldn't narrate the film. In order to keep the actor on board, they nabbed him some screen time and everyone was happy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Realized One Strange Thing About Morgan Freeman</a></span></p><h2 id=jodie-comer-went-big-to-get-big><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jodie Comer Went Big To Get Big</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before Killing Eve was a hot top, <a href=#>star Jodie Comer knew that it would be a career-defining part</a>. Desperate to play the role of an assassin, Comer overlooked the requirements for prime physique, combat skills, and multilingual fluency. For some reason she was never called out and, while short timing didn’t allow her to perfect those skills before filming, she definitely picked up some abilities throughout the span of the show.</p><h2 id=sadie-sink-skated-past-a-question><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sadie Sink Skated Past A Question</span></h2><p>Stranger Things became a hit overnight with just a single season, so it’s no wonder Sadie Sink wanted to get in on that action. In auditioning for the role of Max, the casting director stated that the part <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">required the actress to skateboard</a>, asking whether Sink had experience in that or rollerblading. Sink immediately stated she could rollerblade, stretching the truth as she hadn’t done it in at least a year. It's safe to say she’s learned some basic skateboarding by now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sadie Sink Was Once This Famous Broadway Character (And Other Memorable Roles Besides Stranger Things)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqWfqsBurcKtpqurXay1sHnLopydZZqqwLV506hkoJ2kYq5uvMCrq2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html&text=Famous%20Actors%20Who%20Lied%20Just%20To%20Get%20A%20Part&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html&title=Famous%20Actors%20Who%20Lied%20Just%20To%20Get%20A%20Part" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html&title=Famous%20Actors%20Who%20Lied%20Just%20To%20Get%20A%20Part" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html&title=Famous%20Actors%20Who%20Lied%20Just%20To%20Get%20A%20Part" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamous-actors-who-lied-just-to-get-a-part.html&description=Famous%20Actors%20Who%20Lied%20Just%20To%20Get%20A%20Part" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./intira-jaroenpura-actress-bio-wiki-boyfriend-age-height-weight-net-worth-career-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Intira Jaroenpura (Actress) Bio, Wiki, Boyfriend, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Career, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chris-hansen-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Hansen Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
