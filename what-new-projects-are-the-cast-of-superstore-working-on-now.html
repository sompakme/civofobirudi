The series starred some establisher performers, like America Ferrera and Mark McKinney, but also introduced fans to several new names, like Lauren Ash and Nico Santos. While the sitcom was never one of the most-watched show on TV nor was it nominated for very many awards, it has recently built up a large fanbase thanks to streaming services like Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Was Ben Feldman Up To Before 'Superstore'?</a></span></p><p>While the show ending is sad news for fans, especially those who just got into it, the good news is that all of the cast members are working on new projects that fans can enjoy. Here is what the main cast members of Superstore have been working on since the show ended.</p><h2 id=ben-feldman-jonah-simms><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ben Feldman (Jonah Simms)</span></h2><p>Ben Feldman played the protagonist of Superstore, Jonah Simms. Jonah is a business school dropout who spontaneously decided to apply to work at a Cloud Nine superstore. Prior to being cast on Superstore, Feldman was best known to the world for his role on Mad Men. Ben Feldman's newest project is the Disney+ animated series Monsters At Work, a spinoff of the wildly popular 2001 film Monsters, Inc. Feldman stars alongside original Monsters, Inc. stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman, and he plays the brand new character Tylor Tuskmon. The second season of Monsters At Work will premiere sometime in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=america-ferrera-amy-sosa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>America Ferrera (Amy Sosa)</span></h2><p>America Ferrera, who played Amy Sosa on the first five seasons of Superstore, was probably the most famous cast member when the series first aired. She had made a name for herself playing Betty Suarez on Ugly Betty and for her role in the popular Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants film. She left Superstore ahead of the sixth season to pursue other projects. She is currently an executive producer on the Netflix series Gentefied and she is set to direct her first movie, called I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter sometime soon.</p><h2 id=lauren-ash-dina-fox><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lauren Ash (Dina Fox)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lauren Ash played assistant manager Dina Fox on Superstore and quickly became a fan-favorite. She is currently lending her voice acting talents to the Netflix series Chicago Party Aunt on which she voices the titular character, and she has signed a contract with NBC to write and produce a new sitcom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why America Ferrera Left 'Superstore'</a></span></p><h2 id=colton-dunn-garrett-mcneil><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Colton Dunn (Garrett McNeil)</span></h2><p>Colton Dunn played the heavily sarcastic store worker Garrett McNeil on Superstore. Now that the show is over, he is currently doing voice work on two animated comedy shows: Big City Greens, on which he voices characters named Russell Remington and Brett, and Middlemost Post​​​​​​​, on which he voices Mayor Peeve. Both are children's shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nico-santos-mateo-fernando-aquino-liwanag><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nico Santos (Mateo Fernando Aquino Liwanag)</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​Nico Santos rose to prominence playing Mateo Liwang on Superstore. He had previously played small guest and recurring roles on a few comedy series, but this NBC sitcom was clearly his big break. In 2021, he played voice roles in both a TV series (The Prince on HBO Max) and a movie (Wish Dragon on Netflix). He is current filming a movie called The Re-Education of Molly Singer which also stars Britt Robertson and Jaime Pressly.</p><h2 id=nichole-sakura-cheyenne-thompson><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nichole Sakura (Cheyenne Thompson)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nichole Sakura was only 25 years old when she debuted as the 17-year-old teen mother, Cheyenne, on Superstore. Since Superstore wrapped up, she has performed a voice role in Star Wars: Visions and landed a role in the upcoming ABC series Maggie which is about a young psychic. There were also rumors that Sakura would star in a spin-off about her Superstore character, called Cheyenne and Bo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>America Ferrera Shows BTS Set Of 'Superstore' And Fans Are Both Excited And Sad</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-mckinney-glenn-sturgis><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mark McKinney (Glenn Sturgis)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before his days on Superstore, Mark McKinney was known to the world for his work on sketch comedy shows like The Kids in the Hall and Saturday Night Live. Now, thanks to Superstore, his name is known by a whole younger generation of fans. His biggest upcoming project is a reboot of The Kids in the Hall, which is set to premiere in 2022 – almost thirty years since the original series went off the air. He also provided his voice for a guest starring role on Corner Gas Animated in 2021.</p><h2 id=kaliko-kauahi-sandra-kaluiokalani><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kaliko Kauahi (Sandra Kaluiokalani)</span></h2><p>Kaliko Kauahi played Sandra, a rather strange floor worker, on Superstore. She is the only main cast member to not have started the show in the main cast – she was simply so popular with fans that the producers decided to make her a series regular halfway through the show's run. Kauahi does not have any immediate projects in the work according to IMDb, but it's hard to imagine she'll be out of the game long. Before Superstore, Kauahi was a queen of guest starring roles on TV. She played small roles on shows like The Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Parks and Recreation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 'Superstore' Characters Who Are Similar To 'The Office'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrumw4ypqaiilZjBtHnCmqqtZZ%2BberTBz56prKyfp7Juw86roqKml2K8r3nNqK5mmZ2av6qvwGadnqqimr%2BiecGepWaelaGxrq3NaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html&text=What%20New%20Projects%20Are%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Superstore%27%20Working%20On%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html&title=What%20New%20Projects%20Are%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Superstore%27%20Working%20On%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html&title=What%20New%20Projects%20Are%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Superstore%27%20Working%20On%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html&title=What%20New%20Projects%20Are%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Superstore%27%20Working%20On%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-new-projects-are-the-cast-of-superstore-working-on-now.html&description=What%20New%20Projects%20Are%20The%20Cast%20Of%20%27Superstore%27%20Working%20On%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=next><a href=./talisca-detailed-stats-transfermarkt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Talisca - Detailed stats | Transfermarkt">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
