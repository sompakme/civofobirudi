However, there is no doubt that isn't the case in the real world, since lots of siblings are on bad terms. Based on reports, that also isn't the case for the British royal family, as it has widely been reported that Prince Harry and Prince William are on bad terms.</p><p>However, many royal watchers don't know what the state of King Charles' relationship with his brother, Prince Andrew, is. According to a May 2024 report from The Daily Mail, it seems like Prince Andrew's relationship with his kingly big brother is complicated.</p><p>On the negative side, there have been a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors that King Charles is preparing to evict Prince Andrew</a> from the Royal Lodge he calls home. On top of that, an inside source told The Daily Mail that there had been <strong>a "cooling of relations" between King Charles and Prince Andrew.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Queen-And-Prince-Charles-Will-Help-Disgraced-Andrew-Pay-Legal-Settlement.jpg><p>According to The Daily Mail's reporting, the reason why King Charles reportedly is considering evicting Prince Andrew from the Royal Lodge is simple. Now that Prince Andrew has no source of income since his royal duties were stripped, he can't afford to maintain the property.</p><p>The Daily Mail estimates that<strong> the Royal Lodge requires £400,000 a year just for maintenance</strong>. Since Prince Andrew can't afford that, the press has captured photos of the estate falling into disrepair.</p><p>One example of that is the fact that the media have photographed large patches of missing or flaking pain on the estate's exterior. Given how things look from the outside, it is easy to imagine the state of affairs inside the 30-room estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-7-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Prince Harry Is Involved In Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Scandalous And Shocking Lawsuit Explained">How Prince Harry Is Involved In Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Scandalous And Shocking Lawsuit Explained</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The world was shocked when Prince Harry came up in the shocking lawsuit against Sean 'Diddy' Combs.</p><p>Even though Prince Andrew can't maintain the estate he has lived in for twenty years, he reportedly is adamantly against moving to a new home. According to The Daily Mail's report which cites an insider, Prince Andrew believes that <strong>being forced to move would be too much of a "demotion"</strong>.</p><p>With that reporting in mind, it is easy to see how eviction rumors could lead to a "cooling of relations".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/prince-andrew.jpg><p>On the other hand, it seems that despite everything, <strong>King Charles and Prince Andrew still love one another</strong>, based on the reporting.

It was during those discussions that King Charles reportedly agreed to arrange for Prince Andrew to get a 75-year lease of the Royal Lodge.

That fact is pretty remarkable since King Charles is twelve years older than his younger brother.</p><p>Back when King Charles was still a prince himself, he chose Prince Andrew and their little brother Prince Edward to be his joint best man. As a result, Prince Andrew stood by the man now known as King Charles' side when he married Princess Diana.</p><p>Us Weekly's report also stated that King Charles was the person who introduced Prince Andrew to his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=king-charles-reportedly-called-prince-andrew-39-s-scandal-quot-unsolvable-quot>King Charles Reportedly Called Prince Andrew's Scandal "Unsolvable"</h2><p>In 2021, The Times of London reported on how the man now known as <strong>King Charles felt about Prince Andrew's scandal</strong>.

He has long ago concluded that it is probably an unsolvable problem.

The Prince maintained a relationship with Epstein even after the financier first went to prison for his relationships with minors. Additionally, one of Epstein's accusers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged that she was forced to be with Prince Andrew</a> when she was 17 years old.</p><p>According to The Times of London's insider, King Charles still loved Prince Andrew despite his scandal. On top of that, the insider stated that <strong>King Charles empathized with Prince Andrew</strong> over the backlash he faced.</p><p>“The prince loves his brother and has the ability to have sympathy for the slings and arrows that his brother endures, whatever the reasons may be.
