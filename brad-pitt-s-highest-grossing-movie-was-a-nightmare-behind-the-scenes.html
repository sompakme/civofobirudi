Despite the big box office performance from World War Z, a sequel for the film was never produced. That is probably due to all the issues that threatened the World War Z from pre-production right through to filming and post-production.</p><p>Loosely based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a UN investigator who finds himself trying to protect his family while also trying to find a cure for the disease.</p><p>In the following, we take a look at what happened with production of World War Z and why the film was delayed and had to reshoot the entire ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=world-war-z-was-plagued-with-budget-and-production-issues>World War Z Was Plagued With Budget And Production Issues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/world-war-z.jpg><h3 id=director-vs-screenwriter>Director Vs Screenwriter</h3><p>After Brad Pitt's Plan B production company won the rights to Brook's novel, Michael Straczynski (Thor and Underworld: Awakening) was snapped up to write the script for World War Z. When the script was leaked online in 2008, it was met with praise. The writing was different from the book, where the zombie apocalypse was depicted through fictional newspaper articles and interviews.</p><p>Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace) signed on as a director on Pitt's recommendation, which ultimately led to the production's issues.<strong> Forster and Straczynski clashed immediately</strong>, as both had different ideas on how Brooks' novel should be adapted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Straczynski wanted the script to maintain the cerebral source material, while Forster wanted a more action-packed movie.</strong></p><p>Even after a rewrite, the pair could not agree. Ultimately, the screenwriter and World War Z parted ways, and Matthew Michael Carnahan was brought in to overhaul the script.</p><p><strong>Many cite the hiring of Marc Forster as one of the issues with the production of World War Z.</strong> His only previous venture into action blockbusters was <a href=# rel=nofollow>the poorly received Quantum of Solace</a>. For this reason, Simon Crane, the second-unit director who helped on Brad Pitt’s 2005 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith was brought in.</p><p>“The director was not empowered. There was nobody that steered the ship. … When you get [a director] who can’t do it all … you get a struggle as to whose is the singular voice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This wasn't the first time Marc Foster ran into issues while directing a movie. On the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Bond sequel he made in 2008, on-set issues soon hit</a>. "On 'Quantum' we were f*****," Daniel Craig told Time Out London. "We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brad-pitt-johnny-depp.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Brad Pitt Is Rumored To Have Hired Johnny Depp's Crisis Team After His Children Ruined His Image">Brad Pitt Is Rumored To Have Hired Johnny Depp's Crisis Team After His Children Ruined His Image</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt may have hired a PR crisis team to help restore his image — the same team that helped Johnny Depp avoid being canceled.</p><h3 id=last-minute-production-changes>Last Minute Production Changes</h3><p>Three weeks before shooting of World War Z was expected to start in June 2011, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marc Forster was still making decisions</a> about the look of the zombies and how they would move on-screen.

He needs to get to the center of the buildings and past all the infected zombies. Gerry infects himself with the pathogen, so he can walk past the living dead unharmed. The film ends with an uplifting montage of humanity fighting back and surviving.

It's revealed he hasn't spoken to his family, and his wife has started a relationship with Matthew Fox's paratrooper.</p><p>Those who saw the early cut of World War Z, including Brad Pitt and Paramount, described the ending as "abrupt and incoherent." To fix the ending, Paramount hired <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Damon Lindelof to rewrite the script</a> and spent millions of dollars refilling the last 40 minutes of the zombie blockbuster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUYr2qwNNmn6KfmJrAtXnGq6asq5mjtG65zq%2BgnmWenrSpwMyaqZ5lkpq1qrrDZquhnV2osKa6xKxksKeimXq4rdFmsWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html&text=Brad%20Pitt%27s%20Highest-Grossing%20Movie%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20Behind-The-Scenes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html&title=Brad%20Pitt%27s%20Highest-Grossing%20Movie%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20Behind-The-Scenes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html&title=Brad%20Pitt%27s%20Highest-Grossing%20Movie%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20Behind-The-Scenes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html&title=Brad%20Pitt%27s%20Highest-Grossing%20Movie%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20Behind-The-Scenes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrad-pitt-s-highest-grossing-movie-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes.html&description=Brad%20Pitt%27s%20Highest-Grossing%20Movie%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20Behind-The-Scenes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dr-nicole-martin-husband-net-worth-family-financials.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dr Nicole Martin Husband Net Worth  Family Financials">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./whoopi-goldberg-apologizes-for-using-the-term-gypped-on-the-view.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whoopi Goldberg Apologizes For Using The Term &amp;quot;Gypped&amp;quot; On 'The View'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
