Four words, and we immediately know the movie. <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong> in Jerry Maguire was a star performance after his Mission Impossible film, but one person, one very little person, stole the show—Jonathan Lipnicki as the five-year-old Ray Boyd. And 27 years after the film, the little boy who "won't tell" and bonded with Jerry Maguire on the couch is a grown man and still extremely close with Cruise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jerry Maguire, which was Lipnicki's acting debut, is an Academy Award-winning film and one of the highest-grossing romantic comedies of all time, making more than $274 million globally.</p><p>Lipnicki would go on to steal the show and become one of the most recognizable childhood actors for his movies, like Stuart Little, Stuart Little 2, Like Mike, and The Little Vampire. With his glasses and spiky hair, Lipnicki was slated to become a big movie star, but the actor took a step back. However, Cruise told Lipnicki if you ever need anything, the doors always open.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-and-jonathan-lipnicki-39-s-relationship>Tom Cruise and Jonathan Lipnicki's Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar41699708.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lipnicki and Cruise met in 1996 on the set of Jerry Maguire, which is about a successful sports agent who questions his purpose and place in the world. Until he finally comes to terms with what's wrong with his career and life.</p><p>Cruise played Jerry Maguire, and Lipnicki played the child of Renée Zellweger, Ray Boyd. When the cameras stopped rolling, and the director yelled "cut," that didn't mean Cruise and Lipnicki stopped communicating.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Recalling what it was like on set, Lipnciki said</a> , "Every year, the memories get less and less, but Tom and Renée were really great to work with. Everyone was really a pleasure to work with, and I got lucky that that was my first role with such a positive environment. What I remember was how warm everyone was to me."</p><p>Lipnicki also states Cruise is always there for him personally and professionally, "If I have a question, he's been very open if I need advice. He's always said if you have any questions, the door's always open, and he's always been really responsive and helpful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Of Tom Cruise's Craziest Stunts Performed In His Films</a></span></p><p>He and Cruise keep in touch via email, and Lipnicki says, "I had a new car—I had a 67 Mustang for a while, and he [Cruise] wanted to see it, so I sent him a picture of that. He's a dude!"</p><p>Given the fact they met when Lipnicki was about six years old, it's safe to say the young actor looked up to him—literally.</p><p>And Lipnicki has nothing but the highest respect for Cruise and holds him in high regard, even saying he is his role model. He also states how he admires that Cruise does all his own stunts—something Lipnicki wants to do himself.</p><p>"I would love to [do more stunts]; I just haven't had the chance to do anything too crazy. I had a fight scene with Danny Trejo in Bad Ass 2 a few years ago, which was fun. I'd love to do more of that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lipnicki is very into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and has been practicing for more than ten years. He says staying in tip-top shape is important because it keeps him mentally strong and centered. He also jokingly stated having a six-pack in Hollywood can help book more jobs.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Money Does Tom Cruise Give The Church Of Scientology?</a></span></p><h2 id=jonathan-lipnicki-got-career-changing-advice-from-tom-cruise>Jonathan Lipnicki Got Career-Changing Advice From Tom Cruise</h2><p>Having Tom Cruise as a role model and someone you can go to for advice is very unique. Lipnicki reflects on the advice and guidance he's received from Cruise.</p><p>"It's not even so much what he said, but modeling myself on how hard that guy works," he explains. "If I could work half as hard as that guy works, I'll be doing really well. I mean, the professionalism and work ethic of that guy is insane—he's someone I've always really looked up to."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I always will look up to him; he's always gonna be a role model because nobody I have ever met or worked with has had quite that energy where they are just—that laser focus is fascinating."</p><p>There is the small thing of Cruise being a massive supporter of The Church of Scientology. But, Lipnicki, who is Jewish and has the Star of David tattooed on the left side of his torso, says Cruise has never broached the subject of Scientology.</p><p>Lipnicki said, "He's super respectful—when I had my bar mitzvah, he sent me a letter to congratulate me; he's honestly the most stand-up individual that I've ever met in my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Young '90s Star Jonathan Lipnicki Returns To Acting; Here Are 9 Of His Most Recent Roles</a></span></p><p>Lipnicki still acts today and dreams of making it big as an adult movie star. He says, "Life's short—I have certain dreams, and I'd kick myself if I didn't do everything to reach them. I'm really motivated to prove people wrong, people who don't think child actors can transition into adult actors."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And I consider myself an underdog; I like to fight like my back is against the ropes; I like to really just push for it and act like I've done zero movies in my life," Lipnicki says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKaRqbWiuoyloKmmmZi4qnnAp5tmrJ%2BieqS%2B1KKqnmWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6orLTnqlmopWnv7p5zJqerqGimnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html&text=Jerry%20Maguire%20Star%20Jonathan%20Lipnicki%20Still%20Has%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Tom%20Cruise%20All%20These%20Years%20Later&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html&title=Jerry%20Maguire%20Star%20Jonathan%20Lipnicki%20Still%20Has%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Tom%20Cruise%20All%20These%20Years%20Later" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html&title=Jerry%20Maguire%20Star%20Jonathan%20Lipnicki%20Still%20Has%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Tom%20Cruise%20All%20These%20Years%20Later" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html&title=Jerry%20Maguire%20Star%20Jonathan%20Lipnicki%20Still%20Has%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Tom%20Cruise%20All%20These%20Years%20Later" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerry-maguire-star-jonathan-lipnicki-still-has-a-relationship-with-tom-cruise-all-these-years-later.html&description=Jerry%20Maguire%20Star%20Jonathan%20Lipnicki%20Still%20Has%20A%20Relationship%20With%20Tom%20Cruise%20All%20These%20Years%20Later" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kayla-braxton-wwe-bio-wiki-age-birthday-parents-siblings-husband-married-wwe-salary-net.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kayla Braxton (WWE) Bio, Wiki, Age, Birthday, Parents, Siblings, Husband, Married, WWE, Salary, Net ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-rich-is-lando-norris-father-adam-norris-everything-to-know-about-the-parents-and-net-worth-of-t.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Rich Is Lando Norris Father Adam Norris?
