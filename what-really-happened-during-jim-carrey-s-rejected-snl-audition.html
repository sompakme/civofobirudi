If his career is in fact done, what a run it has been. However, how did he miss out on 'SNL' during his teens? Let's find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-during-jim-carrey-s-snl-audition>What Happened During Jim Carrey's 'SNL' Audition?</h2><p>Jim Carrey might be the worst snub in 'SNL' history, however, he was far from the only one. It is a long list of Hollywood A-listers who go turned down by the show early on during their careers, including Stephen Colbert, Lisa Kudrow, Aubrey Plaza, Zach Galifianakis and so many others.</p><p>Despite the snubs, all the stars mentioned would go on to enjoy stellar careers and down the road, even host the show.</p><p>Jim Carrey had a run himself, playing the role of Joe Bidden for multiple 'SNL' episodes. However, unfortunately, <a href=#>he would step down from the spot after six episodes.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Though my term was only meant to be 6 weeks, I was thrilled to be elected as your SNL President...comedy's highest call of duty," Carrey tweeted. "I would love to go forward knowing that Biden was the victor because I nailed that s***. But I am just one in a long line of proud, fighting SNL Bidens!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Reason Molly Shannon's Career Faded After 'SNL'</a></span></p><p>Jim's career obviously blossomed during the '90s, however, things could've been a lot more different had he been cast on 'SNL' as a teen. Let's look back at how it all went down for the comedy actor and why he was rejected from the show.</p><h2 id=lorne-michaels-was-not-present-for-jim-carrey-s-snl-audition>Lorne Michaels Was Not Present For Jim Carrey's 'SNL' Audition</h2><p>During the '80s, Jim Carrey would audition for 'SNL' multiple times. Given his talents, he would seem like the perfect fit on the show but as it turns out, his timing wasn't ideal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Lorne Michaels in the book Live From New York: The Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, <a href=#>he was not present during Jim's audition</a>. Had he been, things would've been very different, according to the man behind 'SNL'.</p><p>"Jim Carrey never auditioned for me personally. There is an audition tape which we almost played on the twenty-fifth-anniversary show â€” if he had come that night, we would have. We have all the audition tapes. Carrey, I think, auditioned for Al Franken the year I was executive producer and Tom Davis and Al were the producers along with Jim Downey."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Larry David Completely Lost His Cool On 'SNL' During This Skit</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In â€™85 when Brandon got me to come back, his whole argument was I had to learn how to delegate. Dick had run it successfully that way, and so Tom, Al, and Jim did their stuff and I sort of approved things. But later that season, when Brandon was again thinking about canceling the show, he told me, 'You have to completely take charge of everything again.'"</p><p>Jim's career did not suffer from it, as he became an iconic comedy movie star in the '90s. His 'SNL' audition is available online and fans are wondering how he wasn't given the role.</p><h2 id=what-did-the-fans-think-of-the-audition-tape>What Did The Fans Think Of The Audition Tape?</h2><p>The three-minute audition tape is out on YouTube, and it is truly remarkable to see how versatile Jim Carrey was at such a young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What should not come as a surprise is how much fans enjoyed the audition, and are wondering how he didn't get the role.</p><p>"Keep in mind that he was just 18 years old when he did this tape. 18. years. old. Holy shit, thatâ€™s talent right there."</p><p>"I have never seen an actor with such versatile imitations and faces. It's amazing how much control he has in his face muscles and how he we embodies and bring our his characters. I love his life philosophy as well. I just ADORE this person."</p><p>"It would've become the Jim Carrey show if they'd cast him, I have a feeling they knew it too."</p><p>"We're all wondering why he wasn't cast? Can we even imagine how Jim felt? He believed he was born to do this, trained and worked his whole life for this. He was going to make it. And then bam, rejected! Must have felt like the end of the world. He stuck with it, and made it big time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, it is a wonder to think what Carrey's career would've been like had he got cast.
