They may come and go faster than we'd like, but every surgeon hired there is downright gorgeous. We're talking both the men and the women.

However, the man is not exactly a catch.

We can't fault Preston for walking out on his wedding to Cristina. In fact, it was the best thing that could have happened to her. However, he's still not someone we'd want to date ourselves. Preston needs someone at home raising his babies, who is content to sit back and tell him how amazing he is at the end of each day.</p><h2 id=nathan-is-a-bit-of-a-toss-up><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Nathan Is A Bit Of A Toss Up</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nathan-Riggs.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a few episodes there ,Nathan Riggs kind of seemed like the worst dude ever. That being said, we should have known better than to listen to Owen. Riggs did cheat of Megan, but she also cheated on him, so that's their business. He was nice enough to Meredith, though neither of them were all that kind to Maggie. He's not the worst, but certainly not the best.</p><h2 id=richard-has-a-kind-soul-but-his-track-record-isn-t-great><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Richard Has A Kind Soul, But His Track Record Isn't Great</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Richard-Webber.jpg><p>Richard Webber's got a good heart, but he's certainly still flawed.

Sure, he's pretty unpredictable and one can never be too sure what type of&nbsp;career he'll be pursuing next week, but he's a decent guy and he makes sure his wife gets extra breadcrumbs on her mac & cheese.</p><h2 id=george-was-desperate-for-love><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>George Was Desperate For Love</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/George-OMalley-1.jpg><p>Back before we lost George, he really was in need of a solid relationship. However, he always went about finding it in the worst ways. Either by marrying Callie when he didn't actually love her, or when he gave all that up thinking his best friend Izzie could be the girl for him.

He took that brutal beating by Alex back when he was developing a crush on Jo, his relationship with Sam Bello tore him apart, and we've seen him go above and beyond for Meredith.

However, we don't know if that's totally fair. Derek really loved her and their romance was certainly one for the ages. He could let his ego get in the way, but most of them time he came around.

However, during those episodes, he did showcase a lot of excellent qualities.
