The second rule is to learn how to properly use Photoshop. In fact, there should be a special course for famous celebs when it comes to social media. It’s always important to thoroughly examine the image before social media gets a hold of it and tears it to pieces. Many celebs made that mistake and didn’t get the positive reaction they were hoping for. If it’s not near perfection, then there is almost a guarantee that it’ll be mocked and made fun of. Some fans are like hawks that never let their prey escape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities spend a good amount of their day posing for photographers. Sometimes, they’re featured in steamy photoshoots and other times are photographed walking the red carpet or going about their day. Instagram has become one of the most popular social media platforms. Many celebrities have a large following on Instagram. In fact, several celebrities have been able to reach a wider audience and grow their fanbase. It has helped them become even bigger stars. However, there is a great risk when posting online because the slightest mishap will not go unnoticed. Everything from random objects in the background, mirror reflections, and bad Photoshop will often betray the celebs. Instead of an alluring and seductive pic that gets millions of likes, they end up red-faced and embarrassed. Here is a look at 15 Embarrassing Things Spotted in the Background of Celebrity Instagram posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton</a> loves to post steamy&nbsp;pics to Instagram showing off her stunning beauty and extravagant lifestyle. In this pic, she made that same attempt but failed to check the background before snapping the selfie. Paris is a member of the famous Hilton family. She is best known for her role in the reality series The Simple Life with former best friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Richie</a>. She is more infamously known for a private video that was leaked just before the premiere of the series. She loves to post sultry and sensual pics to Instagram or pics of her enjoying the lifestyle of the rich and famous. However, the reaction to this pic is certainly not what she wanted. Fans were rolling around laughing after noticing the toilet paper roll in the background. It seems minor and unimportant but because it’s Paris, fans just couldn’t help it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blac-chyna-amp-kim-kardashian><strong>Blac Chyna & Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>At one time, <a href=#>Blac Chyna</a> was closely associated with the world famous Kardashian family. From 2016 to 2017, she was in an intense relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Kardashian</a>. Chyna first gained fame as an urban model and appeared in several top magazines. In this pic, she poses alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a> as they show off their world-famous “assets.” Kim is a master of the selfie and social media game. The media and fans love to get a glimpse into Kim’s life and the various products she uses. Kim has millions of followers online waiting for her next sizzling selfie. Fans were elated to see that they got two for the price of one. However, fans were quick to notice something wasn’t right with the pic. They pointed out that the door frame in the background bends in an odd way. Kim has often been accused of editing her pics and likely did so in this one as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-minaj><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p>This isn’t a pic where something scandalous is spotted in the background. In this case, it’s right up in the front and nearly impossible to miss. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj</a> doesn’t seem to notice that she is slightly exposed in this pic. Minaj often posts risqué and racy images to Instagram that often have people talking. She is considered by many to be one of the best female MC’s of all time. She has released several popular albums, including&nbsp;Pink Friday, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, and The Pinkprint. It’s not uncommon for Minaj to be exposed in her pics. In fact, it seems to happen a lot to her. Here, she posted a selfie to Instagram and several fans immediately pointed out that her bra didn’t fit her well. This is a problem Minaj has faced in several other pics as well. However, the slip-ups don’t seem to bother her at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a> is one of the most popular and active celebs on social media. She loves to post all kinds of pics online. She posts everything from selfies with fans to partying hard with friends. She’s also been accused of using Photoshop, and this pic is a good example of that. Swift tours the world selling out stadiums with thousands of her adoring and screaming fans. Her use of social media has given her a way to connect with her fans like no other celeb. However, her fans have also demonstrated the uncanny ability to catch the slightest things wrong in her Instagram pics.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In this pic, fans pointed out that it’s likely Photoshopped because of the weird bend in the otherwise straight railing. It’s almost impossible to see the alteration because it’s so minor. Also, Taylor and her three gorgeous&nbsp;friends are pretty distracting, although some were able to see past that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miranda-kerr><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miranda Kerr</a> has been featured in numerous breathtaking photoshoots but none gained as much attention online as this picture. She is one of the most beautiful and richest models in the world. She often ranks high on Forbes' Highest Earning models list. She became world famous as one of the Victoria’s Secret Angels. However, despite her incredible beauty, it appears that she too finds the need to Photoshop some pics. In 2012, Kerr posted a steamy pic with models <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alessandra Ambrosio</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doutzen Kroes</a> from the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. The pic received a great deal of likes and had fans drooling. However, she reposted the pic one year later, but fans spotted something different about the pics. Fans pointed out that in the second image, she had Photoshopped her waist to make it smaller. This clearly isn’t the background but it was still spotted by fans. She denied that claim and said she hadn’t even realized the pic was changed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears><strong>Britney Spears</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a> is a chart-topping artist that was once the biggest teen sensation in the world and was dubbed the “Princess of Pop.” She gained a great deal of attention for her erratic behavior, as well as her tumultuous relationships. She went through a very difficult time in her life and was eventually able to overcome a lot. She has also done a great deal to get into phenomenal shape. Lately, she loves to show off her hard work on Instagram, and she has every right to do so. However, she should always be careful when using Photoshop because these fans have the eyesight of a hawk. In this pic, she showed off her bikini body as she laid out next to the pool. Most people believe that she used Photoshop to make herself even skinnier. Several fans pointed out that she appears to have no ribs, and the walkway around the pool briefly disappears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a> posted this pic to Instagram, her fans instantly noticed something that was off. Like many celebs, she tries to sneak in some Photoshop in the background but nothing gets by her followers. Lindsay Lohan has appeared in numerous memorable films, such as&nbsp;<i>The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday,</i> and <i>Mean Girls.</i> She became a household name and one of the most famous faces in the world. She later struggled with addiction and personal issues. She had several run-ins with the law and spent some time in rehab. She has attempted to clean herself up and put her life back together. She posted this pic to Instagram hoping to read some positive comments. However, her fans ended up accusing her of Photoshopping the pic. Fans pointed out that the staircase behind her is oddly shaped. It’s almost like her elbow is cutting through the stairs and the space time continuum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc><strong>Beyoncé</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé</a> is one of the most famous and recognizable stars in the world. She is one of the bestselling artists in history. She has released several critically-acclaimed albums, such as&nbsp;B’Day, I Am…Sasha Fierce, and Lemonade. She is also known for her provocative and luscious pictures. Photographers love to work with her and advertisers want her to be the face of their brand. She is also active on social media and gives a rare insight into her private life. She is known for being very private and keeping a low profile. However, she still posts various photos to her Instagram. She has been accused of Photoshopping her pics on several occasions. This pic in particular caught the public’s attention. Fans noticed that in the foreground of the pic, her phone and wine glass are weirdly shaped likely due to the Photoshop. Celebs must keep in mind that fans never miss a thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez</a> started her career with a wholesome Disney image. She starred in the Disney series Wizards of Waverly Place. However, later she developed a more mature and adult image. She had everyone talking with her role in the risqué and controversial film Spring Breakers. She is a part of the generation of celebs that are experts at social media. She is active on social media and loves connecting with her fans. She often posts all kinds of pics from having a relaxing day to partying all night. In this pic, Gomez showed a bit more than she usually does. The second the pic showed up, online fans noted that Gomez was unknowingly exposing herself. In 2014, Gomez had a girl’s night out and seemed to party all night long. She posed with her other friends, but her top slipped down and her chest ever so slightly slipped out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-goodger><strong>Lauren Goodger</strong></h2><p>Some celebs are caught trying to Photoshop a pic or forgot something embarrassing in the background. Lauren Goodger posted this sultry pic online and fans instantly recognized that it wasn’t her. Goodger is a U.K. reality TV personality and glamour model. She gained attention for her appearances in the reality show The Only Way Is Essex. She later appeared in U.K. Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing on Ice. She also enjoys posting pics to her Instagram even when they’re not her. She caused a bit of an uproar when she posted this pic to her Instagram of model Carmen Ortega. Goodger didn’t make it clear that this wasn’t her. The pic was also altered to give the model in the pic a larger waist. Goodger claims that a fan sent her the pic and apologized for not making it clear that it wasn’t her. There is nothing celebs can get past their eagle-eyed fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-mytton><strong>Alex Mytton</strong></h2><p>It might be a bit difficult to tell, but if you look closely, you can see a naked man in the background. Actually, it’s pretty obvious so you don’t have to look too close. This Instagram pic had a lot of people talking after it was allegedly leaked online. The naked man is reality TV star Alex Mytton who is best known for his appearance on the U.K. reality series Made In Chelsea. In 2015, Alex was vacationing with his then-girlfriend, Nicola Hughes. She posted a pic to Instagram in which Mytton was in the background and exposed. The racy image was deleted minutes later but it was enough time for all of her followers to see the image. It was shared all over social media and became a big story for the reality star. He said, “I think at one stage it was even trending on Twitter, which is rather a bizarre sensation knowing it's gone quite so public.”</p><h2 id=amanda-holden><strong>Amanda Holden</strong></h2><p>There clearly is something strange and bizarre going on in this image. In this steamy pic, <a href=#>Amanda Holden</a> poses in a tiny bikini on the beach. Judging from the background, she is either at the nexus of the universe or she’s been playing around with some Photoshop. Holden is best known as the long-running judge on the reality competition series Britain’s Got Talent. She also hosted several other series, including&nbsp;Give a Pet a Home, This Morning, and Superstar. She also had a very successful theater career. She posted this pic showing off her bikini body but many fans looked right past that at the oddly-shaped ocean. She was likely hoping for a lot of likes but instead was busted using Photoshop. In the background of the pic, the ocean seems to be split in half and moving upward. She’s not the first celeb to Photoshop a pic but is clearly terrible at using it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robin-thicke><strong>Robin Thicke</strong></h2><p>Celebs are learning that it’s very important to tidy up before taking pics. They’re also learning that mirror reflections are their worst enemies. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin Thicke</a> is a world-famous recording artist best known for the hit single “Blurred Lines.” He made headlines with his marriage and highly-publicized divorce from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paula Patton</a>. Rumors have swirled that Thicke was possibly cheating on his then-wife. Even if Thicke denied it, this pic certainly didn’t help his defense. In 2013, he took this picture with a fan, Lana Scolaro. After she posted it online, many people pointed out that his hand is on Lana’s derriere. Lana admitted she knew his hand was placed there but didn’t notice it in the pic. She said, “I didn’t even know that was the reflection until I uploaded it, and someone commented on it.” Technically, Thicke didn’t upload the image but he still learned a valuable lesson about cameras and mirrors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p>Kim Kardashian has one of the largest social media followings. She receives huge endorsement deals from various products to post to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. She is best known for her appearances in the reality series <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i>. However, her popularity has grown with her online presence, and she is able to reach many fans. She often posts sensual and seductive pics to Instagram that literally break the Internet. This image is actually from a video she posted that had fans squinting at the screen. Fans noted two lines of a white substance in the background and wondered if it was cocaine. At first, Kim claimed it was simply candy that she had purchased for her children earlier. However, after examining the video and table, she realized it was just the design of the table. She posted several followup videos to ensure fans knew the truth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a> learned the hard way about the importance of tidying up before snapping a selfie. You never know what random objects could be mistaken for. Grande is a hugely successful recording artist and released the albums Yours Truly, My Everything, and Dangerous Woman. Grande has grown up in the public eye and, like many stars her age, is very active on social media. She often posts pics to Instagram showing off her wardrobe. However, one particular selfie raised a lot of questions for fans. In 2013, she posted a pic to Instagram of her latest and cutest outfit.
