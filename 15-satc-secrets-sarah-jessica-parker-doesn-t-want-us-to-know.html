The show revolved around a fashionable columnist named Carrie Bradshaw and her three friends: Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda. The four women went through plenty of romantic ups and downs while trying to navigate their lives in New York City and keep their careers afloat. Throughout the show’s six year run, it got plenty of critical acclaim and won millions of fans from all over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while it seems like the show’s four stars – Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, and Cynthia Nixon – were all great friends, apparently that wasn’t the case behind closed doors. There are a lot of things that happened behind the scenes and there are secrets about the show that Sarah Jessica doesn’t want the world to know about. Things were so bad at one point that certain ladies couldn’t stand working with one another.</p><p>With that being said, we’ve got 15 secrets from Sex and the City that you probably didn’t know about. This will change the way you think about this iconic girl power television show.</p><h2 id=sjp-and-kim-hated-each-other><strong>SJP and Kim Hated Each Other</strong></h2><p>Here’s a little secret that a lot of Sex and the City fans didn’t know: apparently, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall hated each other. They were such enemies, that they couldn’t stand being in the same room as one another and had to fake it in front of the cameras (talk about good acting). Their feud only came to light recently when Kim called out (and publicly) dragged SJP for being a fake, good-for-nothing friend. And she meant every word of it, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the death of her brother, Kim wrote this message to SJP on her Instagram account, “Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already.) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.”</p><h2 id=the-other-co-stars-took-sides><strong>The Other Co-Stars Took Sides</strong></h2><p>It’s without a doubt that Sarah Jessica and Kim’s feud had to take a serious toll on everyone. It probably wasn’t easy trying to film scenes when SJP and Kim were too busy giving stink eye to one another. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. And the other ladies of the show were forced to take sides. Talk about an unhealthy work environment.</p><p>Here’s what Page Six writes, “Parker and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda), gravitated toward each other and pretty quickly included co-star Kristin Davis (Charlotte) in their group. For the first couple of years, Cattrall had a real ally on set in the form of series creator and producer Darren Star. But when he left after the second season and was replaced by Parker’s friend Michael Patrick King, Cattrall was completely isolated.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-was-no-equal-pay><strong>There Was No Equal Pay</strong></h2><p>This blows big time. According to reports, there was no equal pay among the ladies of Sex and the City. Even though each actress was a star in her own right, it was Sarah Jessica Parker who cashed in the most money in her HBO paychecks. And we can see how this might have been a little unfair to the other ladies. After all, we know it was Kim Cattrall’s character Samantha who often stole the show. She had the best lines, the best comedic timing and the best scenes. But apparently, she had the worst paycheck.</p><p>SJP once said, “Work was never about wanting fame or money. I never thought about that. I loved getting the job, going to rehearsal, playing someone else, hanging around with a bunch of actors. I needed that, the way you need water.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sjp-had-a-special-clause-in-her-contract><strong>SJP Had A Special Clause In Her Contract</strong></h2><p>As we all know, there was a lot of action on Sex and the City. As a matter of fact,&nbsp;some shocking things&nbsp;happened during almost every episode of the series. But have you ever noticed that there were some actresses that&nbsp;were baring it all&nbsp;more often than others? That’s because the ladies all had different contracts. And even though Carrie Bradshaw was the face of the show, SJP always made sure that she kept herself fully covered up. That’s because she had a clause in her contract that meant she didn't have to show herself in ways the other actresses had to.&nbsp; The other actresses, on the other hand, had to show a lot of skin. It was all a part of their storylines, and especially for Samantha. Seeing how SJP didn’t get along with Kim and knowing just how much creative control she had on the show, this all makes sense now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cynthia-nixon-had-to-change-her-appearance><strong>Cynthia Nixon Had To Change Her Appearance</strong></h2><p>As we all know there can only be one star of the show, and in this case, only one blonde bombshell. And that title belonged to Sarah Jessica Parker’s character and not Cynthia Nixon. Little do people know but Cynthia is actually a natural blonde. She was forced to color her hair to a strawberry blonde color in order to stand out as the redhead of the group. Plus, Kim is also a blonde and you can’t have too many blondes sitting in one table, apparently.</p><p>But that’s not to say that Cynthia looked bad. In fact, she looked pretty gorgeous with her new hair color. She’s a beautiful woman. But the moment the show ended, Cynthia went back to being a natural blonde and has kept it that way ever since.</p><h2 id=kim-didn-t-want-to-play-samantha><strong>Kim Didn’t Want To Play Samantha</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, Kim Cattrall didn’t want to play Samantha. Even though her character had plenty of fans (and some of the best scenes in the series), the executive producers had to do some serious convincing in order to get Kim to sign up. And who can blame her? After all, the character did and said a lot of risky things. Samantha was a go-getter, a trendsetter and a man-eater!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her part, Kim has never confirmed these rumors. And at this point, it’s unlikely that she will. After all, Samantha helped make her a household name and give her the huge following that she has today. Kim once said, “At the beginning of every role I take, I have to start from basics and build it up. It's like a new construction.”</p><h2 id=sjp-s-pregnancy-was-the-reason-why-season-5-was-shortened><strong>SJP’s Pregnancy Was The Reason Why Season 5 Was Shortened</strong></h2><p>As we all know, Sex and the City revolved around Sarah Jessica Parker, her life, her personal issues, and of course, HER schedule. That’s why it doesn’t come as a surprise to many people when they hear that the fifth season was shortened because of her.</p><p>The day that she found out that she was pregnant, SJP didn’t feel very well and had her assistant fetch her a home pregnancy test. And wouldn’t you know, she was pregnant with her twins! That’s when producers decided to shorten the season to only 8 episodes in order to accommodate their star. Also, many eagle-eye viewers have noticed that you can see SJP’s baby bump at Bitsy and Bobby’s Hamptons wedding. There’s no denying that she was glowing and very pregnant at that point!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-always-wore-high-heels><strong>Kim Always Wore High Heels</strong></h2><p>And while Kim did have her reservations about playing Samantha, if there was one thing she didn’t have any doubts about, it was her character’s shoe collection. Kim always insisted on wearing high heels, even if her character didn’t have to. For Kim, appearance was always very important to her character. Samantha was a woman of power and each and every outfit she wore was a reflection of that.</p><p>Kim once said, “What I wear is a reflection of where I am going and how I am feeling. If I'm in a good mood, it's got to be cashmere and jeans&nbsp;– just something comfy, soft and warm. When I'm down, I might find something that I haven't worn for a while that was bought for me&nbsp;– or wear a brooch or a pair of shoes that are like old friends.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=none-of-the-outfits-were-ever-repeated><strong>None Of The Outfits Were Ever Repeated</strong></h2><p>We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: the Sex and the City wardrobe deserved a credit on its own because seriously, many of the outfits we saw were truly iconic and memorable. If it weren’t for the fashion, Sex and the City wouldn’t be the show that it was. And according to insiders, none of the outfits were ever repeated. The show’s costume designer did a very good job to make sure that every outfit was uniquely put together and fit for that episode’s storyline.</p><p>While filming, Kristin Davis once put it this way: “I think fashion can have a very negative impact on young people who feel they have to be thin. I am not part of that trend. There is so much pressure on teenage girls.”</p><h2 id=kristen-davis-kept-the-show-a-secret-from-her-family><strong>Kristen Davis Kept The Show A Secret From Her Family</strong></h2><p>At this point it’s safe to say that the show broke a lot of television barriers. After all, it was the first cable network series to win an Emmy! And even though it was very successful all over the world, Kristen Davis once admitted that she kept the show a secret from her family. She never told her grandmother the title of the show because she says she wouldn’t have understood it anyway. Now that’s a secret that is very hard to keep, right?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During filming, Kristin Davis once said, “I think I can speak for all four of us on the show here. We all consider ourselves to be feminists and we get very upset when people don't think we are. We're like, where did this come from? Of course we are.”</p><h2 id=sjp-wanted-to-be-like-edina-from-absolutely-fabulous><strong>SJP Wanted To Be Like Edina From Absolutely Fabulous</strong></h2><p>This might be hard to believe, but apparently Sarah Jessica Parker looked for inspiration for the show to none other than the BBC hit comedy Absolutely Fabulous. Anyone who has ever watched it knows that Edina and Carrie Bradshaw are two totally different people. They have nothing in common. But apparently, SJP wanted Carrie to “trip” and fall over herself the same way Edina did on her show.</p><p>SJP once said, “There are a lot of physical comedians that I admire… Jennifer Saunders in Absolutely Fabulous. I can’t believe some of the stuff she does. It’s so old-fashioned, broad, hilarious. I’ve never seen somebody fall so much. The people in Ab Fab are really in my head when I do my work, I want to be as good as they are.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sjp-kept-all-of-the-clothes><strong>SJP Kept All Of The Clothes</strong></h2><p>Apparently, SJP got to enjoy a lot of perks when it came to playing someone so iconic as Carrie Bradshaw. As we all know, Carrie’s wardrobe had a life of its own! It was also the reason why millions of people tuned in to the show every Sunday. They wanted to see first hand what Carrie was wearing that week. And yes, SJP got to keep all of the clothes that her character wore. Talk about a dream come true for so many people, right? And apparently, SJP has no regrets, either. After all, she is often considered one of the most stylish women in Hollywood. Anyone who has followed her on the red carpet probably know what we are talking about.</p><p>Speaking about the show’s iconic wardrobe, SJP once said, “People should dress the way they want. Any rules for age or shape are silly.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sjp-wanted-to-be-the-star-of-the-show><strong>SJP Wanted To Be The Star Of The Show</strong></h2><p>You’d think that the ladies of Sex and the City would take note and do what the cast of Friends did before them: and that’s stick with each other like glue. When it came to the Friends cast, everyone was considered an equal and they all fought to earn the same salary. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case here. Sarah Jessica Parker made it pretty clear from the get go that she was the only star of the show. And this might also be a reason why so many co-stars are still bitter about it to this very day.</p><p>She once said, “I feel like you have to be so precise in what you are going to say, or you can be hammered if you say it the wrong way. That part makes feel bummed out because sometimes these things can take a while to figure out. Different people formulate things in different ways and have different processes. I feel like let's just take a deep breath and not be so perfectionistic about it all.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-last-episode-was-a-mess><strong>The Last Episode Was A Mess</strong></h2><p>Even though Sex and the City ended with a bang (and we mean that in every way possible) the last episode was a mess, so to speak. They had such a hard time wrapping it up, that the producers only managed to finish it all up on a Wednesday, even though it was supposed to air the following Sunday. Yikes. Of course, the women of Sex and the City have never made any comments about this. They want to their fans to know that the last episode was just as perfect as the rest of the series was. We now know that wasn’t the truth at all.</p><p>Speaking about life after the show, Kim said, “There's a positive side to film and television, the sense of feeding into the theater... Your fans will follow you, hopefully, and be open-minded to see you play other things and experience other stories you want to tell.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-of-the-cocktails-were-fake><strong>All Of The Cocktails Were Fake</strong></h2><p>According to Sarah Jessica Parker, the Sex and the City ladies might have done a lot of drinking on screen, but off screen it was a different story. That’s because all of the cocktails were fake! So no, no one got&nbsp;out of hand during shooting. But if there’s one thing that they did do, it was eat, eat, and eat! According to the ladies, they didn’t hold back when it came to eating during their restaurant scenes.</p><p>Speaking about her Sex and the City days, SJP said, “My job requires me to put on a little dress and run around the streets of New York in heels. But I also had the financial means to hire a yoga teacher to come to my house while my sitter watched the newborn. For 95 percent of the world, that's not realistic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6tK3TnGSsnZOnsrW%2FjKyYq5mYYremv9KimpploJa%2FrLHRZpuonaOjwW7DwKerZq2jYsGwecqnprBn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html&text=15%20SATC%20Secrets%20Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker%20Doesnt%20Want%20Us%20To%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html&title=15%20SATC%20Secrets%20Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker%20Doesnt%20Want%20Us%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html&title=15%20SATC%20Secrets%20Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker%20Doesnt%20Want%20Us%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html&title=15%20SATC%20Secrets%20Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker%20Doesnt%20Want%20Us%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-satc-secrets-sarah-jessica-parker-doesn-t-want-us-to-know.html&description=15%20SATC%20Secrets%20Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker%20Doesnt%20Want%20Us%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-american-homecoming-s-geffri-maya-on-simone-s-lando-damon-choice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All American: Homecoming's Geffri Maya on Simone's Lando-Damon Choice">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-wasteland-singer-brent-faiyaz-is-an-artist-to-watch-out-for.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why 'Wasteland' Singer Brent Faiyaz Is An Artist To Watch Out For">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
