Ever since the release of her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">self-titled debut album</a> back in 2006, she’s gained worldwide popularity and recognition as an award-winning singer and songwriter.Now, with 10 studio albums, three live albums, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 200 original songs</a>, her career seems to be doing better than ever. The success of her latest album is proof of this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Billboard</a>, Midnights, Taylor’s latest album, is record-breaking. It has earned over 1.3 million equivalent album units in the U.S., only in the first four days after its release. In addition to this, the album’s 20 songs have generated more than 357 million on-demand streams, making it one of the top streamed albums of all times.</p><p>But Taylor Swift’s talent and success, is not the only thing the media talks about. Over the years, the award-winning singer and songwriter has been constantly featured in the tabloids for her romantic life. In fact, she’s well-known for writing songs about some of her past relationships. In a recent interview, Taylor talked more about her dating life and the high standards she has for the people she dates. And she revealed her rules for texting prospective romantic interests.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Ex-Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-s-music-career-shifted-in-2006>Taylor Swift's Music Career Shifted In 2006</h2><p>Taylor Swift moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville at a young age to pursue a career as a country singer. This move seemed to work because in 2005, the young singer met Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was about to launch his independent record label, Big Machine Records. And with just 16 years, Taylor became the label’s first-ever signee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This led to the release of her debut album, Taylor Swift, in 2006. The album, as well as Swift’s songwriting abilities, were highly-praised by the critics and Taylor was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards and, eventually, got a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist. Her next to albums, Fearless and Speak Now, were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. And she worked with BMR until the release of her sixth album, Reputation, in 2017.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ten People Taylor Swift Has Called Out By Name In Her Songs</a></span></p><p>Shortly after releasing her polarizing album, Swift left Borchetta’s label and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group. This would later lead to her <a href=#>feud with Scooter Braun</a> over the ownership of her songs.</p><p>Even though she’s focused on creating new music, working on albums like Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights, ever since 2021, Taylor Swift has also been releasing re-recorded versions of her older albums. All of this in an attemp to gain control and ownership of the songs' original recordings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ever-since-she-started-writing-taylor-incorporates-her-life-into-her-songs>Ever Since She Started Writing, Taylor Incorporates Her Life Into Her Songs</h2><p>It’s no secret that plenty of Taylor Swift’s songs take inspiration from the singer’s personal life. And even though she’s never admitted to it, fans think many of her songs have been written to some of her most notorious ex-boyfriends. A clear example of this is All Too Well, a song fans believe talks about <a href=#>Taylor’s relationship with Jake Gyllenhal</a>.</p><p>Of course, fans can’t stop talking about this song since Taylor recently released its re-recording. She also released All Too Well: The Short Film, a 15-minute movie of the never-heard-before 10 minutes, starring <a href=#>Dylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift revealed why she chooses to write about her personal experience and love life in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concert special for Netflix</a>. “When I write a song, it’s usually me just trying to get past something and understand something I’m going through by writing about it and that was definitely the case when I wrote the next song that I’m going to play.”, Swift admitted.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-revealed-she-doesn-rsquo-t-make-the-first-move-when-texting-prospective-romantic-partners>Taylor Swift Revealed She Doesn’t Make The First Move When Texting Prospective Romantic Partners</h2><p>Most recently, a magazine released a list of the singer’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nine rules for dating</a>. Many of these rules make sense. Like getting along with her family and friends, being ok with having songs written about them, and being on the same page about having kids in the future. But there’s a rule that sticks out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Of Her Boyfriends Has Taylor Swift Collaborated With?</a></span></p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with TheBoot.com</a>, Taylor revealed her texting rules when it comes to boyfriends. “I have this rule: I don't call a guy first. You can't ever send two text messages in a row,” she said. “If they don't answer your text messages, then that's fine. Don't stress it out and send another text message.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor’s rules when it comes to texting prospective romantic interest can be summarized as keeping her cool and showing she’s interest without doing all the work. And it seems these tips pay off. After all, Taylor Swift has been <a href=#>dating English actor, Joe Alywn</a>, since 2016. Although the couple tries to maintain their relationship private, it’s clear to fans and the media that they’re very happy together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmJbAbq2MrKuroZOperPBy55ksKCVo3qqwIycpqado2LBsHnTnq%2BtoZ6ceqO72J%2Bpop2emcBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20A%20Strict%20Rule%20When%20It%20Comes%20To%20Texting%20Boyfriends&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20A%20Strict%20Rule%20When%20It%20Comes%20To%20Texting%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20A%20Strict%20Rule%20When%20It%20Comes%20To%20Texting%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20A%20Strict%20Rule%20When%20It%20Comes%20To%20Texting%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-has-a-strict-rule-when-it-comes-to-texting-boyfriends.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Has%20A%20Strict%20Rule%20When%20It%20Comes%20To%20Texting%20Boyfriends" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./woman-claims-police-officers-fatally-shot-her-unarmed-fiancee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman Claims Police Officers Fatally Shot Her Unarmed Fiancee">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kenya-moore-s-ex-matt-jordan-charged-with-assaulting-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenya Moores Ex Matt Jordan Charged With Assaulting Girlfriend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
