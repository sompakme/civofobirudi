Stern took the blame for it, stating that he was angry for no reason back in the day, and wasn't happy with the fact that Dave was on TV and had an audience. Nowadays, the two are on amicable terms, and the same holds true for Howard's relationship with Bill Maher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we're going to take a closer look at why their relationship broke down, and how things finally changed. We'll also take a closer look at their interviews, and the interesting reveal Howard made about conducting a one-on-one in front of a live audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>One Of The Most-Watched Howard Stern Show Performances Ever Featured Adam Levine Stunning The Audience With A Very Unexpected Cover</a></span></p><h2 id=bill-maher-and-howard-stern-finally-ended-their-lengthy-feud>Bill Maher And Howard Stern Finally Ended Their Lengthy Feud</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/howard-stern.jpg><p>Howard Stern took part in an interview alongside Bill Maher on Real Time, and the same took place on The Howard Stern Show, with Maher appearing as a guest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maher's return to the show had lots of significance given that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he hadn't taken part in two decades</a>. Both Stern and Maher were quick to put the blame on themselves for the breakdown.</p><p>“Back in those days, look, we were both a**holes,” Bill Maher said to Howard. “Isn’t it nice that we’re at this age now? Where we repair relationships.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Howard Stern Was Left Baffled Over Orlando Blooms's Low Salary For Lord Of The Rings</a></span></p><p>Stern and Maher put their feud on the back-burner during both the interviews, and discussed topics of the lighthearted nature, including Maher's reveal that he kept his aspirations to himself, not even telling his own parents about his goal to become a comedian.</p><p>“I knew what I wanted to do when I was 10 or even before. I never said it to anybody because I didn’t have that kind of confidence … I kept it a complete secret,” he told Howard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maher's appearance on the show was an important moment for the two, however, it was that much surprising when Stern appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, given his lack of interviews over the years.</p><h2 id=howard-stern-told-bill-maher-he-prefers-interviews-without-an-audience-given-that-it-leads-to-more-personal-information-in-a-comfortable-setting>Howard Stern Told Bill Maher He Prefers Interviews Without An Audience Given That It Leads To More Personal Information In A Comfortable Setting</h2><p>It is clear to fans of Howard Stern, the host has changed his ways along the way, but one thing remains the same, he loves to have an intimate setting during his interviews. According to Howard, the best part about not having an audience is the fact that he forgets a camera is there to begin with.</p><p>Speaking alongside Bill Maher, the host noted that the reception Howard got is the beauty of having an audience. But Stern gave his honest take.</p><p>He said, "I like this but when I'm working, I like that there is no audience, it is quiet in the studio, you forget that you're on the radio and a lot of truth comes out."</p><p>Stern would go on to use his interview with Maher as an example, praising how open their conversation was, discussing Bill's time in comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The interview moment can be seen below, posted to the Real Time with Bill Maher YouTube channel.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Guest Sean Evans Allegedly Didn't Want On Hot Ones And His Idol He Still Can't Lock Down</a></span></p><p>As for the feedback from the interview, fans loved the exchange and openness from Howard in particular.</p><p>"I'm not really a fan of either of these guys, but I have to say after watching this interview I find Stern quite endearing. Those years in therapy are worth every minute and dollar if it helps make him a better person. It's also quite striking how much charisma he has! For a recluse like him who loves his solitary comforts, he really commanded that room."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan writes, "It's nice now that Howard has dropped the 'shock jock' and just become an honestly human being. despite all his anxiety and angst and anger, he's genuinely a caring person. That's nice."</p><p>It seems like Howard's approach may have also rubbed off on Maher in recent years.</p><h2 id=bill-maher-has-also-shifted-opting-for-a-more-39-personal-act-39-these-days>Bill Maher Has Also Shifted Opting For A More 'Personal Act' These Days</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher-performing.jpg><p>Given his interview with Charlotte Observer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Maher also plans on doing more personal acts</a>, detailing personalized stories, and expressing them in a quiet setting via a podcast. The host is known for his work alongside an audience on Real Time discussing politics, but has different plans for the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, "I enjoy now being more personal in my act. And I think the audience does, too. But (I started) the podcast specifically for that reason. By the way, sometimes the podcast bleeds into politics, too. I never know where it’s gonna go. I have no agenda, I have no preparation, and I’m stoned out of my mind. If politics come up, it comes up. But it’s much more like just having dinner or drinks with a friend and, you know, sometimes you talk about s--- like that, sometimes you don’t."</p><p>Similar to Howard Stern, fans will be onboard for this type of change from Maher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9OeqadloprDpq3Lnptmr5iueqmxjKucn62jmsBuwM5mm6hlmaPBpr7Vopywq12strW0jJpknKqfrLFusNSroKefXZ67tbHRr6Cer12strW0jJugpaRdoq6psdFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html&text=Howard%20Stern%20Didn%27t%20Mind%20Bill%20Maher%27s%20Live%20Audience%2c%20But%20Revealed%20Why%20He%20Refuses%20To%20Do%20Interviews%20Wi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Didn%27t%20Mind%20Bill%20Maher%27s%20Live%20Audience%2c%20But%20Revealed%20Why%20He%20Refuses%20To%20Do%20Interviews%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Didn%27t%20Mind%20Bill%20Maher%27s%20Live%20Audience%2c%20But%20Revealed%20Why%20He%20Refuses%20To%20Do%20Interviews%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html&title=Howard%20Stern%20Didn%27t%20Mind%20Bill%20Maher%27s%20Live%20Audience%2c%20But%20Revealed%20Why%20He%20Refuses%20To%20Do%20Interviews%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-didn-t-mind-bill-maher-s-live-audience-but-revealed-why-he-refuses-to-do-interviews-wi.html&description=Howard%20Stern%20Didn%27t%20Mind%20Bill%20Maher%27s%20Live%20Audience%2c%20But%20Revealed%20Why%20He%20Refuses%20To%20Do%20Interviews%20Wi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kendall-jenner-slays-in-a-suede-bomber-jacket-at-snl-afterparty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendall Jenner Slays in a Suede Bomber Jacket at SNL Afterparty">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aliko-dangote-s-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Aliko Dangotes Children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
