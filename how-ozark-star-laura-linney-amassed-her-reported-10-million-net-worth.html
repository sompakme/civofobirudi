You might <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remember her from films like Love Actually</a> and The Truman Show, and tons of other great things. More recently she's appeared in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viggo Mortensen's directorial debut, Falling</a>.</p><p>With her talents though, you'd expect her to have a higher net worth&nbsp;than her $10 million. So, before we travel back to the remote&nbsp;resort community&nbsp;in&nbsp;Missouri, let's take a look at how Linney amassed her net worth.</p><h2 id=she-graduated-from-juilliard>She Graduated From Juilliard</h2><p>Some&nbsp;of Linney's first roles&nbsp;came&nbsp;in Lorenzo's Oil, Dave, and&nbsp;Searching for Bobby Fischer, but they were all minor. Her first television role came in the limited series,&nbsp;<i>Tales of the City,&nbsp;</i>where she played Mary Ann Singleton. She'd later reprise her role two more times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her first big films&nbsp;came shortly after in A Simple Twist of Fate with Steven Martin in 1994 and Congo in 1995.&nbsp;During these first great roles, she also found time to star on Broadway. First with&nbsp;<i>Hedda Gabler,&nbsp;</i>which earned her a Joe A. Callaway Award, and later,&nbsp;<i>Holiday.</i></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Ozark Moments That Are Better Than The Season 3 Finale</a></span></p><p>Next came the thrillers Primal Fear (1996) and Absolute Power (1997). In 1998 she gained recognition for her role in The Truman Show and received positive reviews for her role in&nbsp;You Can Count on Me in 2000, earning&nbsp;her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was reportedly paid $10,000 for the role.</a></p><p>Linney was busy that year, starring in the&nbsp;films&nbsp;Lush, The House of Mirth, and Maze as well.</p><p>In 2002 she starred in the&nbsp;television movie Wild Iris, which won her first Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. That same year she also co-starred with Liam Neeson in the Broadway revival, The Crucible, which earned her a Best Actress Tony Award nomination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next year she starred in another critically acclaimed film, Mystic River, directed by Clint Eastwood. It earned her first BAFTA Award nomination. Love Actually and The Life of David Gale came that same year as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Interesting Facts About The Filming Of Ozark</a></span></p><p>She gained her second Academy Award nomination, this time for Best Supporting Actress, her first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, and a Golden Globe Award for her work in Kinsey. She won her second Emmy nomination that year as well, for her guest appearances on the show Frasier, and her second Tony Award nomination for the play Sight Unseen.</p><p>Things didn't slow down for Linney in 2005. Her film The Squid and the Whale received rave reviews as well and earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination. The Exorcism of Emily Rose was next<b>&nbsp;</b>on her agenda and then Driving Lessons, Man of the Year (both in 2006), Jindabyne,&nbsp;The Nanny Diaries (2007). She won her third Academy Award nomination for her performance in&nbsp;The Savages that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, she won her third Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Abigail Adams in the mini-series John Adams, which won the most Emmys for a mini-series ever. She returned to the theater the same year for the revival of Les Liaisons Dangereuses.</p><p>Two years later she received her third Tony Award nomination for her performance in the play Time Stands Still, and starred in the show The Big C, which she also executive produced. She earned a Golden Globe Award for her performance and her fourth Primetime Emmy Award for the last season of the show.</p><h2 id=her-carrer-kept-getting-better-and-better-into-ozark>Her Carrer Kept Getting Better And Better Into 'Ozark'</h2><p>In 2015 she starred in Mr. Holmes alongside Ian McKellen which received positive reviews. A year later she appeared in another Eastwood film, Sully, and Nocturnal Animals.</p><p>She was then cast as Wendy in Ozark in 2017, and thankfully, because in-between seasons of the show, she hasn't had the greatest of roles. Wendy has earned her&nbsp;two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for both season one and two, and a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for season two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I got the script and read the script, you could see the potential not only for the character of Wendy but for the narrative, as well. It just had tremendous potential," Linney told Collider. "That was obvious, right off the bat. I wasn’t looking to do a series, but I’ve always really, really admired Jason [Bateman]. . . The whole company was wonderful and the production was wonderful. I really feel like I fell into a pot of honey. It was really fun."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Was 'Ozark' Star Jason Bateman's First Ever Role</a></span></p><p>According to Variety, Linney and Bateman made $300,000 per episode in seasons one and two. That amount probably went up as the show gained popularity.</p><p>This past year she starred in Mortensen's Falling, and the play, My Name Is Lucy Barton.</p><p>Linney's social media also contributes to her net worth, through advertising and sponsorships. On Instagram, Linney had 52.7K followers and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earns between $214.5 to $357.5 per sponsor post with&nbsp;an engagement rate of 3.99%.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So she's not doing that bad for herself. There's also her partnership with PBS Masterpiece, where she introduces many of the channel's shows, including Downton Abbey.</p><p>No matter what Linney stars in though, it usually turns out to be critically acclaimed. We just think that she should have won tons of awards for Wendy by now...and a higher paycheck for her talents.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ozark’s Jason Bateman: Here's What To Know About The Actor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dpMeivspmqq2ZomK5osHRmmSloZ6jsrp5wKaYrKuVmXqpsdFmqZ6on6fBprCMamdmpZmhuaq7zWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html&text=How%20%27Ozark%27%20Star%20Laura%20Linney%20Amassed%20Her%20Reported%20%2410%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Ozark%27%20Star%20Laura%20Linney%20Amassed%20Her%20Reported%20%2410%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Ozark%27%20Star%20Laura%20Linney%20Amassed%20Her%20Reported%20%2410%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html&title=How%20%27Ozark%27%20Star%20Laura%20Linney%20Amassed%20Her%20Reported%20%2410%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-ozark-star-laura-linney-amassed-her-reported-10-million-net-worth.html&description=How%20%27Ozark%27%20Star%20Laura%20Linney%20Amassed%20Her%20Reported%20%2410%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jean-paul-gaultier-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jean-Paul Gaultier Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hayes-andrew-hurd-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hayes Andrew Hurd Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
