Reports say the two were actually employees of the big retail company.&nbsp;They started out as friends before deciding to take it a step further by dating.&nbsp;It then lasted two years, at which time they were convinced that marriage was the best thing left between them.&nbsp;On June 22, 2006, Danielle and Adam were declared husband and wife.&nbsp;They then moved from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Houston, Texas.</span></p><p><span>It was probably in their plans to try and have a baby after they got married, but none were forthcoming.&nbsp;As they tried harder and harder, they made no progress which led them to think about seeing a doctor.&nbsp;Le Busby went following this, test results revealed that although Adam had a low sperm count, his wife Danielle had irregular ovulation.&nbsp;The solution to their problem was proposed and it required the use of a specialized drug.&nbsp;They were both placed on Clomid through 5 cycles (5 months) of intrauterine insemination on Clomid before they began to consider in vitro fertilization.&nbsp;However, the couple opted for Femara and tried intrauterine insemination again, which worked.&nbsp;VS’</span></p><p><span>After Blayke’s birth, Danielle Busby describes the feeling as incredible and a miracle to have a baby growing inside her.&nbsp;In fact, she said, “I really enjoyed being pregnant,” but the question that remained to be answered was, would their infertility issues increase again?&nbsp;Well, it became a problem the second time around, but with Fermara the couple overcame it.&nbsp;She got pregnant on her fourth cycle of intrauterine insemination, but it was no ordinary pregnancy.&nbsp;Her ultrasound revealed that she had four bags of babies developing in her womb with two babies in one bag.&nbsp;All went well with the pregnancy and on April 8, 2015 she was delivered from Ava Lane and Olivia Marie (eldest and identical), Hazel Grace,</span></p><p><span>The quintuplets were born prematurely and had to spend the first few months of their lives in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Woman’s Hospital Texas.&nbsp;After they were born, a heart murmur was detected in the girls but it was quickly treated.&nbsp;Hazel, however, had even more health issues to deal with.&nbsp;She had congenital nystagmus which caused her to have uncontrolled eye movements.&nbsp;In others to see well, she had to move her head in unusual angels.&nbsp;She underwent surgery for this and additionally, her doctor prescribed the use of specialized glasses that can correct the abnormality as her eye grows.</span></p><p><span>The Busby couple first appeared on the TLC’s American reality series OutDaughtered on May 10, 2016, after their lives were turned upside down for good following the birth of their daughters.&nbsp;The show, which chronicles the family life of Danielle Busby, her husband and their children, has, since its inception, continued to attract a huge number of fans to the delight of the Busbys.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-value></span><strong><span>Net value</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>If not for the quintuplets, we might never have had a reason to write about Adam and Danielle Busby.&nbsp;Similarly, you might also have never had a reason to seek information about them.&nbsp;It is evident that the birth of the daughters brought fame and fortune to their family and in this respect the net worth of the family has been pegged at $300,000.</span></p><p><span>In addition to their reality TV show, Danielle and Adam reportedly run an indoor cycling studio in League City, Texas called Rush Cycle.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=father-sisters></span><strong><span>father, sisters</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The prominent father figure in Danielle Busby’s life is that of her stepfather.&nbsp;The old man even made an appearance on their television show OutDaughtered in an episode where Adam suffered from postpartum depression.&nbsp;He explained that what he was going through was normal but his was 5 times more.&nbsp;He advised him to seek professional help and to this advice, Adam heeded.&nbsp;Since then, Adam has been doing much better.</span></p><p><span>Danielle’s sisters, as mentioned earlier, are twins- Ashley and Crystal.&nbsp;They haven’t made an appearance on the show and we don’t know if they will.&nbsp;Since there are no negative reports about them, it is likely that everything will be fine with them.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRo7amuMueZJuto5fGbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6ywK2fnqpdlrSmedKiqq2doqh6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section
