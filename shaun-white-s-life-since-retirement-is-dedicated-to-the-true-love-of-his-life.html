White made his Olympic debut when he was just 19-years-old, and ever since he has been a consistent threat at all snowboarding competitions. Following the Olympic Winter Games in 2022, however, White made the decision that it was time to retire from the sport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Shaun White Feel About Nina Dobrev's On-Screen Love Interests?</a></span></p><p>Dobrev is famous in her own right, but from a very different world. She is an actress best known for portraying Elena Gilbert on the CW's The Vampire Diaries. She was the lead of the series for six seasons before she decided to say goodbye to vampires and move on to other projects. The two have been dating for several years now, and are quite serious. Here's how Shaun White is supporting Nina Dobrev now that he is retired.</p><h2 id=how-did-nina-dobrev-and-shaun-white-meet>How Did Nina Dobrev And Shaun White Meet?</h2><p>Nina Dobrev and Shaun White are one of Hollywood's cutest couples. Nina Dobrev hit it big in the acting world when she was cast as Elena Gilbert on The Vampire Diaries back in 2009. Before then, Dobrev had starred on the hit Canadian teen drama Degrassi.</p><p>Shaun White is of course a star in his own right, but from a very different world. He is a famous snowboarder, and he made his final run in the Olympics during the 2022 Bejing Olympics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering they have extremely different careers, fans were curious how the two met back in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nina-dobrev-(1).jpg><p>When Dobrev and White first met in 2019, White actually had no idea that Dobrev was a popular celebrity.</p><p>Both stars spoke at a Tony Robbins event in Florida, and afterward decided to grab a bite to eat.</p><p>"The place was packed," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White recalled to People about his first dinner with Dobrev</a>. "And she was like, 'Let me go see if I can get a table.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Look At Nina Dobrev And Shaun White's Relationship Timeline</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a famous snowboarding and gold-medal Olympian, White assumed that the actress would drop his name in order to get a table. Actually, Dobrev did not need his help in securing herself and him a seat at the restaurant.</p><p>"Can we get a photo... with her?"</p><p>"And I was like, 'What's happening? What's going on?' It as actually really funny."</p><h2 id=how-long-have-nina-dobrev-and-shaun-white-been-dating>How Long Have Nina Dobrev And Shaun White Been Dating?</h2><p>Soon after meeting in 2019 at the Tony Robbins event, Shaun White and Nina Dobrev began seeing each other romantically.

Instead of hitting pause on their relationship, the two decided to use their time off to build a solid foundation for their relationship.</p><p>Dobrev and White moved in together as soon as the world went into lockdown.</p><p>"We went to the hardware store bought a bunch of paint, and brushes and definitely got in our heads, but it was really fun," White said of their time quarantining.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nina Dobrev Wasn't Impressed By Shaun White The Very First Time They Met</a></span></p><p>Even their dogs ended up getting along.

He competed in his first Olympic Winter Games when he was just 19-years-old, and his career was only an upward trajectory from there. White made the difficult decision at 35 to step away from his career in snowboarding following his final appearance in the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Bejing.</p><p>Though girlfriend Nina Dobrev was unable to attend the Olympics due to the pandemic restrictions, she was seen cheering him on with his family and friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, White is putting his energy elsewhere.
