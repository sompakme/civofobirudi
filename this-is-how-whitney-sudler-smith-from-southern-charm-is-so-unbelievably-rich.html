During an interview with Urban Daddy, Whitney was asked how he came up with the conception of the TV series Southern Charm, and he said, “Initially, I come from more of a film background, and it started out as a documentary. I’d become friends with Thomas Ravenel, who lived in Charleston, I think he'd’ just gotten out of prison. I felt he’d be this really compelling character. And I figured he’d make interesting subject matter for a documentary and/or TV show. I did this pilot thinking it was going to be a documentary kind of exploring the myth of the Old South and reconstruction and all this b*lls**t. And my agent said at the time, 'No, no, no, this should be a TV show, these characters are all compelling,' and we just kind of built it out from there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Southern Charm's Madison LeCroy Can't Help But Feud With Austen Kroll's Girlfriend">Southern Charm's Madison LeCroy Can't Help But Feud With Austen Kroll's Girlfriend</a></span></p><p>Whitney Sudler-Smith is proud of his show and states that there’s no comparison between the Bravo Television series and other shows.</p><p>Whitney is also the executive producer <a href=# rel=nofollow>of Southern Charm New Orleans</a>.</p><h2 id=whitney-sudler-smith-39-s-mother-is-a-cast-on-the-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Whitney Sudler-Smith's Mother Is A Cast On The Show</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/patricia-altschul.png><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Whitney's mother is one of the cast of Southern Charm and she is the richest </a>on the ranking of the show with a net worth of $100 million.
