However, while some cast members of the first cult classic film are returning for this second chapter nearly three decades later, there's one beloved character that almost reprise their role... until they didnt.</p><p>Thora Birch, who played protagonist Max Dennison's (Omri Katz) sassy little sister Dani, almost returned for the sequel, set to debut later this year. However, while original plans for the new movie included a good role for Dani in adult-form, Birch had to decline due to scheduling conflicts.</p><h2 id=why-isn-39-t-thora-birch-39-s-dani-in-39-hocus-pocus-2-39>Why Isn't Thora Birch's Dani In 'Hocus Pocus 2'?</h2><p>Birch has recently explained why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she won't be returning as Dani Dennison in the 'Hocus Pocus' sequel</a> directed by <a href=#>Anne Fletcher ('The Proposal,' '27 Dresses')</a> and written by Jen D'Angelo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everybody tried so hard. Everybody tried so hard to make that happen and it just didn't, but everybody tried so hard," Birch told 'ComicBook.com' about her possible return.</p><p>"That was everybody's intention," she added.</p><p>While production and fans would love to see Birch reprise the role of Dani, the actress revealed she would be more interested in playing another character in the franchise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is The Cast Of 'Hocus Pocus' Is Doing Today?</a></span></p><p>"But you know what? At the end of the day, just between you and I, I'd probably rather play Winifred in the future. I'd probably rather play Winnie," Birch said of the astute Sanderson witches leader played by Bette Midler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thora-birch-has-exited-netflix-series-39-wednesday-39>Thora Birch Has Exited Netflix Series 'Wednesday'</h2><p>At the end of last year, it was revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Birch exited Netflix's upcoming series 'Wednesday.'</a> Directed by Tim Burton, the series will zero in on the adolescence of Wednesday Addams, played by 'You' star Jenna Ortega.</p><p>"Thora has returned to the States to attend to a personal matter and will not be returning to the production," a representative for series producer MGM said in a statement to 'Deadline' in December 2021.</p><p>Prior to her departure, Birch had already filmed most of her scenes as Tamara Novak, Wednesday's dorm mother at Nevermore Academy. As per IMDb, Birch is scheduled to appear in six out of eight episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-would-have-birch-39-s-role-on-39-hocus-pocus-2-39-been>What Would Have Birch's Role On 'Hocus Pocus 2' Been?</h2><p>While Birch will still appear on 'Wednesday,' a surprise return as Dani in 'Hocus Pocus 2' doesn't seem to be on the table.</p><p>According to original plans, Birch was asked to return as Dani to help the brand new protagonists of 'Hocus Pocus 2' â€” played by 'Gossip Girl' actress Whitney Peak, 'Dirt' star Lilia Buckingham, and 'American Horror Stories' alumna Belissa Escobedoâ€” fight off the Sanderson sisters.</p><p>Fans of the first movie will remember Dani playing a pivotal role in helping her brother Max and <a href=#>his crush Allison (Vinessa Shaw)</a>. Thanks to Dani's experience on the first movie, she would now be an expert, providing the younger characters with some invaluable advice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Thora Birch Has Done Since â€˜Hocus Pocusâ€™</a></span></p><p>It is safe to assume that, after Birch turned down the role, the script had to be changed accordingly and that the girls will get the help of another character. But will Dani be mentioned at all? Only time will tell.</p><h2 id=who-will-return-for-39-hocus-pocus-2-39>Who Will Return for 'Hocus Pocus 2'?</h2><p>Dani may not be returning to Salem in the new instalment of 'Hocus Pocus,' but there are other major stars that will reprise their roles, much to the delight of fans.</p><p>Of course, Midler, <a href=#>Kathy Najimi</a> and Sarah Jessica Parker will make their long-anticipated return as the Sanderson trio: Winifred aka Winnie, Mary and Sarah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Doug Jones will also make an appearance in the role of Billy Butcherson, introduced in the first movie. The character is an old boyfriend Winnie poisoned in 1693 and resurrected as a zombie three centuries later.</p><p>As for Katz and Shaw, it doesn't look like they will return, but fans better keep their eyes peeled for a very unexpected cameo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bette Midler Spills The Secrets Behind The 'Hocus Pocus' Reunion</a></span></p><p>Alongside the confirmed, returning stars and the three new protagonists, the sequel will also feature 'Ted Lasso' and 'Game of Thrones' star Hannah Waddingham, Tony Hale, Sam Richardson and 'RuPaul's Drag Race' queen Ginger Minj (credited as Joshua Allan Ead), Kornbread and Kahmora Hall as the drag versions of Winnie, Mary and Sarah, respectively.</p><h2 id=what-birch-has-said-about-starring-on-39-hocus-pocus-39>What Birch Has Said About Starring On 'Hocus Pocus'</h2><p>Birch, who starred on 'Hocus Pocus' when she was around ten, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has fond memories of playing Dani</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The fact that 'Hocus Pocus' found a niche in that world where it cannot be extricated from the holiday itself to me is really amazing," she told 'ABC News' in 2015.</p><p>"I'm really surprised, but humbled and happy to be a part of something like that. I had the best time on that film â€” maybe more than any other movie I worked on."</p><p>Birch also revealed being close to her younger co-stars, particularly Shaw.</p><p>"All three of us [Birch, Shaw and Katz], we got along great," Birch said.</p><p>"Me and Vinessa, whenever we see each other, it's like old friends getting back together.
