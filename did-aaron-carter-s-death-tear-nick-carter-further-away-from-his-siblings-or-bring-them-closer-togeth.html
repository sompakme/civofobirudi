While they both entered the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> industry at young ages, their lives went in different directions. Nick joined the Backstreet Boys and Aaron faced years of suffering and pain. Even though Aaron was a popular singer in his own right, all the cash and celebrity in the world can't help someone feel better.</p><p>Now that Aaron is gone, his family is of course still affected by that terrible day when they learned that he had passed away. In some cases, tragedy will bond people and they will let go of any problems they had in the past. In other cases, things are still as complicated as ever. Nick Carter has two siblings who are still alive: <a href=#>Aaron's twin sister Angel Carter</a>, and Bobbie Jean Carter. He also has three half-siblings: Kaden Brent Carter, Taelyn Dobson, and Virginia Marie Carter. Here's whether Nick Carter has a relationship with his siblings today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-nick-carter-get-along-with-his-sister-bobbie-jean-carter>Does Nick Carter Get Along With His Sister Bobbie Jean Carter?</h2><p>There aren't any details available about Nick Carter's half-siblings Virginia Marie Carter, Taelyn Dobson, and Kaden Brent Carter. According to The Sun, Kaden is 17 years old, but that seems to be the only thing people are aware of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/why-wasn-t-aaron-carter-speaking-to-his-brother-before-his-death_.jpg><p>Nick Carter's sister Bobbie Jean Carter, however, is a bit more of a public figure. Unfortunately, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobbie Jean Carter has gotten into legal trouble</a>, and that is why people know who she is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Aaron Carter Really Lost His $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In June 2023, TMZ reported that Bobbie Jean Carter was at a Hobby Lobby in Florida and reportedly shoplifted $55 worth of stickers. But because the police explained that she was also carrying fentanyl, this became more serious, and she was arrested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That wasn't the first time that Bobby Jean was in the news. Radar Online reported that back in 2002, she was arrested for allegedly hurting two people back in 2002. The publication reported that Bobbie Jean was with Angel at the time.</p><p>The police said that Bobbie Jean was "sticking out the back window up to her waist wanting to exit the vehicle to talk. She was upset saying that three girls had jumped her sister and she protected her. She continued by saying that this is what happens when you mess with her family, adding that they are a close family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-carter-looking-emotional-in-an-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Bobbie Jean was 20, and now she's 41. There is no evidence that she and Nick Carter see each other or seem to even be part of each other's lives these days. Fans do know that Nick spent some time distancing himself from Aaron Carter when Aaron was going through a lot. Sadly, the brothers weren't good on terms when Aaron died.</p><p>According to Newsweek, Aaron was really upset about this and hoped that they could start talking again. Before he passed away, Aaron was on the podcast No Jumper and he said, "I just hope that relationship gets fixed… With my brother."</p><p>It's possible that Nick is focused on his own family and career and that he finds it hard to think about the hard times his sister has gone through. It's also possible that Nick tried to offer his sister help and support. But since he hasn't talked about that, no one can be sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nick-carter.jpg><p>Nick has been honest about feeling bad about his family, though. It never seems like this is something that he takes lightly, and he seems to think about his siblings all the time.</p><p>In 2017, E! News reported that he appeared on the reality series Boy Bands and talked Jaden Gray, a teenager who went through a lot with his dad. Nick said, "I understand exactly what you're going through when it comes to having a hard upbringing in a family. No matter what happens, or what they say or do, you still love them."</p><h2 id=does-nick-carter-get-along-with-his-sister-angel-carter>Does Nick Carter Get Along With His Sister Angel Carter?</h2><p>While it doesn't look like Nick Carter has said that he and Angel Carter get along really well, they have come together in the wake of Aaron Carter's death.

As Nick told Entertainment Tonight in August 2023, "It's definitely been tough for me and my family. It is still something that we are still processing, to this day. I don't think we will ever really get over it. It's been a lot for us, and we are finding ways to try and take a really tragic situation in our family and do something with it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYmqqfo3qkrdGtnKurXZmyosDHZpqhmZ6csqV5zaKapGWTlr%2B1sdFmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaeewal50qKZpaGenMBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html&text=Did%20Aaron%20Carter%27s%20Death%20Tear%20Nick%20Carter%20Further%20Away%20From%20His%20Siblings%20Or%20Bring%20Them%20Closer%20Togeth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html&title=Did%20Aaron%20Carter%27s%20Death%20Tear%20Nick%20Carter%20Further%20Away%20From%20His%20Siblings%20Or%20Bring%20Them%20Closer%20Togeth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html&title=Did%20Aaron%20Carter%27s%20Death%20Tear%20Nick%20Carter%20Further%20Away%20From%20His%20Siblings%20Or%20Bring%20Them%20Closer%20Togeth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html&title=Did%20Aaron%20Carter%27s%20Death%20Tear%20Nick%20Carter%20Further%20Away%20From%20His%20Siblings%20Or%20Bring%20Them%20Closer%20Togeth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-aaron-carter-s-death-tear-nick-carter-further-away-from-his-siblings-or-bring-them-closer-togeth.html&description=Did%20Aaron%20Carter%27s%20Death%20Tear%20Nick%20Carter%20Further%20Away%20From%20His%20Siblings%20Or%20Bring%20Them%20Closer%20Togeth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-cena-talks-struggling-to-balance-acting-wrestling-and-when-he-ll-retire-from-wwe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Cena Talks Struggling To Balance Acting &amp;amp; Wrestling, And When Hell Retire From WWE">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./carlos-rodriguez-pastor-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
