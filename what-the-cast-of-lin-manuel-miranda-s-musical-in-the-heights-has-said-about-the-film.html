Are the cast members, producer, and director happy about the movie's outcome? Let's find out here in what the cast of In the Heights has said about the movie.</p><h2 id=lin-manuel-miranda><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Lin-Manuel Miranda</span></h2><p>Addressing the colorism accusation, producer Lin-Manuel Miranda quickly apologized on social media as soon as the movie hit premieres.</p><p>"I hear that, without sufficient dark-skinned Afro-Latino representation, the world feels extractive of the community we wanted so much to represent with pride and joy. In trying to paint a mosaic of this community, we fell short. I'm truly sorry," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-m-chu><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jon M Chu</span></h2><p>For Jon M Chu, directing In the Heights after Crazy Rich Asians must have been a crazy shift. In fact, in an interview with NPR, he mentioned that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he experienced a vast challenge</a> to bring a Broadway piece into a cinematic experience.</p><p>"They were all in the streets yelling at us in all the good ways. And to have even photographers yell at us to take pictures, to promote a movie and then to be in the Palace Theatre," he said, "it was everything I hoped for what going back to the movies would feel like."</p><h2 id=jimmy-smits><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jimmy Smits</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Smits finds his voice as Kevin Rosario in In the Heights.

I saw it lauded and got to know Lin while I was working in New York," he said.</p><h2 id=gregory-diaz-iv><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gregory Diaz IV</span></h2><p>Thanks to In the Heights, 16-year-old newcomer Gregory Diaz IV has just made his big Hollywood breakthrough. Prior to the film, he was Quentin in Netflix's Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Seeing kids my age on the stage gave me the feeling of just wanting to do that and believing that I could," the young star said. "That was really the first goal that I had set for myself in my young career, to be a part of that, and fortunately enough I was able to do that."</p><h2 id=daphne-rubin-vega><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Daphne Rubin-Vega</span></h2><p>Daphne Rubin-Vega portrays the salon owner Daniela in In the Height. According to the actress, what makes her character so special is how she relates to her in every way.</p><p>"I love her, because there is a Daniela in all of our lives," Rubin-Vega says. "You go to her when you need a pep talk, when you need counsel, when you need to hear the truth. She’s very New York."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olga-merediz><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Olga Merediz</span></h2><p>In In the Heights, Olga Merediz is "Abuela," an all-time wise matriarch of the barrio who raised Usnavi after the death of his parents.</p><p>"I tried to just bring all those matriarchal figures from my past — friends' mothers, my aunts, what they've gone through — and I've tried to just piece her together into this quintessential matriarch that we all want to be or have," she said about her character.</p><h2 id=melissa-barrera><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Melissa Barrera</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Melissa Barrera was only a high school student in her home country of Mexico when she witnessed In the Heights on Broadway for the first time.

I was really new and really green, so this was my first in-person audition for a movie in L.A.," she said.</p><h2 id=corey-hawkins><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Corey Hawkins</span></h2><p>Before In the Heights, Corey Hawkins kicked off his acting career on Broadway. He made his Broadway debut in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet back in 2013 before joining The Walking Dead's star-studded cast members as Heath in 2015.</p><p>"I grew up in a theater. That’s kind of where I cut my teeth. On Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-off Broadway, workshops, grinding in New York," he recalled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anthony-ramos><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Anthony Ramos</span></h2><p>For Anthony Ramos, portraying the character reminisces him of his hometown of Bushwick, Brooklyn, where he grew up with his mother and two siblings in the rough barrio.</p><p>"There were moments of trauma and stuff like that," he said.
