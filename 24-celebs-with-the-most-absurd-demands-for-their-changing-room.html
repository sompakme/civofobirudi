Though, it rarely comes to that. There are some celebrities out there that believe that they are entitled to anything that they ask for. It doesn’t matter how ridiculous the request is; they don’t want it questioned, they just want whatever it is they are asking for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You might be surprised what some of these celebrities will ask for and we might go so far as to say that some of the demands are a tad bit “crazy.” Celebrities like Kanye West, Beyoncé, and Lady Gaga are some of the most demanding people on the list, but would you believe that Jennifer Aniston also made the list with a demand that most might think was a little much? The problem is if these celebrities don’t get what they want, people tend to see a different side of them. A side we don’t see very much of. When it comes to the everyday folk, sometimes it’s best to just give the celebrity what they want. America’s Sweetheart was a movie based on the industry and it showed Catherine Zeta-Jones’ character as one of the most demanding stars in the movies. She demanded no smoking in the buildings that she was visiting and didn’t even want the smell of a certain flower near her. The movie was a comedy, but there is a lot of truth to that kind of behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-minaj-loves-fried-chicken><strong>Nicki Minaj Loves Fried Chicken</strong></h2><p>When Nicki Minaj goes on tour, she has some specific requests when it comes to her dressing rooms. She’s always had a reputation of a diva, so it’s not surprising that she has certain requests when it comes to what she wants when she’s on tour. Her demands though, aren’t as bad as you might think they are.</p><p><strong>Her requests include spicy fried chicken wings for when she’s hungry. She also wants space heaters to keep her warm, candles that smell like sweet baked goods, and chewing gums in three different flavors.</strong></p><p>As if that’s not enough, she also wants a cheese platter in the dressing room. These items certainly aren’t extreme nor would they be hard to come by, but it does make us wish we had someone at our beck and call all the time.</p><h2 id=mariah-carey-wanted-to-be-surrounded-by-kittens><strong>Mariah Carey Wanted To Be Surrounded By Kittens</strong></h2><p>Mariah Carey is a notorious diva in Hollywood, so although her request is absolutely absurd and bizarre, it still doesn’t surprise us at all. She was asked to turn on the Westfield Christmas lights in 2009 and since it was the Christmas season, she decided to put in a request.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She wanted to be surrounded by 20 kittens and 100 doves as she turned on the lights. The people in charge must have thought she had completely lost her mind.</strong></p><p>They actually turned the singer down because they weren’t going to be part of that level of crazy. It’s not her first crazy request either, she’s also requested multiple bottles of vitamin water in which to wash her dogs as well as telling an assistant to walk backward in front of her to make sure she doesn’t fall.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-takes-great-care-of-his-skin><strong>Kanye West Takes Great Care Of His Skin</strong></h2><p>When Kanye West is on tour, he has some pretty steep demands and he doesn’t care if it means the organizers have to spend thousands of dollars on him. When it comes to his skincare, he is very serious about it.</p><p><strong>Instead of bringing his own skincare products though, he requests that they are there for him in the dressing rooms when he is on tour.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His list of demands includes two tubes of Carmex lip balm, a bottle of Neutrogena dandruff shampoo, one bar of L’Occitane soap, Neutrogena face scrub, and Nivea Intensive Moisturizing Lotion. It sounds like Neutrogena should be hiring him to be a spokesperson for them. He also isn’t a fan of man-made fibers and has stated that he will not hire a driver that wears anything like that.</p><h2 id=beyonc-can-only-have-pepsi-products><strong>Beyoncé Can Only Have Pepsi Products</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the dressing room of this superstar, she has some pretty steep demands herself. Beyoncé has always been Queen Bee, so we’re not surprised that she likes things a certain way. She demands that her dressing room be exactly 78 degrees.</p><p><strong>She is another singer that likes to have chicken in her dressing room and she wants “heavily seasoned” chicken legs with cayenne pepper.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also requested that the room have rose-scented candles. Don’t even think about putting Coca-Cola products in her room because she can only be seen drinking Pepsi products because she is under a contractual agreement. She stipulated a list that includes “one case of Aquafina water (half cold, half room temperature), one hot tea set up (please have new coffee pot), sliced lemons wedges, lighter for candles, and a CD player.”</p><h2 id=cher-takes-very-good-care-of-her-wigs><strong>Cher Takes Very Good Care Of Her Wigs</strong></h2><p>Cher is a true performer, she’s a legend in the industry and when it comes to doing a show, she goes all out. She’s from the era of performers who actually performed, there was no lip syncing and her stage time included wigs and costumes. She loves putting on a good show and fans are never disappointed. She really enjoys herself and you can see the extent that she goes to with these photos.</p><p><strong>When she goes on tour, she demands that her wigs have their own room.</strong></p><p>It’s a bizarre request and it is something that probably makes organizers roll their eyes. But considering how many wigs she takes on tour with her, they probably do need their own room. It’s a small price to pay to have a legend perform for you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adele-has-high-class-demands><strong>Adele Has High-Class Demands</strong></h2><p>We would never have thought that Adele had diva requests, but she’s right up there with Beyoncé when it comes to creating a big list of demands. For some reason, Adele has banned organic honey from entering her dressing room and she wants six metal teaspoons in the room. She requests Marlboro Lights and she only wants the “best quality” red wine that they can find. If she’s hungry, she wants chicken salad sandwiches. If you think that’s a lot well, we’ve only just begun the list. Her demands include</p><p><strong>“twelve small bottles still (non-carbonated) spring water (at room temperature), one electric kettle for boiling water, six large mugs for tea. (All mugs should be new, washed, and dried), two "Squeezy" bottles clear honey (not organic),</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>an assortment of chewing gum, one disposable cigarette lighter, small selection fresh fruit, to include bananas, apples, grapes, fresh berries but no citrus fruit, a small plate of assorted freshly made, individually wrapped sandwiches, to include chicken salad. Sandwiches must not contain tomatoes, vinegar, chilli, or citrus fruit.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-needs-to-be-cooled-off><strong>Jennifer Aniston Needs To Be Cooled Off</strong></h2><p>It was hot in New York City during the filming of The Bounty Hunter starring Gerard Butler. Jennifer Aniston regularly needed to be cooled down and if that meant having her assistant hold up a large fan in front of her, then that’s what was going to happen. We understand that she can’t be sweaty and worn out when she’s on set and no one wants to have to keep retouching her makeup, but we feel like making someone hold up a fan for you might be a little much.</p><p><strong>She could have easily just stood in front of it to get cooled off.</strong></p><p>It’s probably not the type of picture that celebrities like people to see because it can give them the reputation of being a diva. Don’t worry Aniston; you’re forgiven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lopez-demands-that-everything-be-white><strong>Jennifer Lopez Demands That Everything Be White</strong></h2><p>It doesn’t matter whether she is on tour in her dressing room or working on her TV show, her quarters have to be immaculate.</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez does not like to be distracted by colors, so much so that she wants her dressing room to be void of all colors.</strong></p><p>She wants the walls to be white, the tables to be white, and all other furniture to be white. She even wants the drapes and the flowers in the room to be white. When they put candles in her room, you better believe those are white as well. It seems particularly bizarre but then again, are we really that surprised? Another thing that she requests in her room is bottles of tepid water. We’re not sure why anyone likes having lukewarm water, but it’s a request many celebs make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-loves-her-starbucks><strong>Taylor Swift Loves Her Starbucks</strong></h2><p>Taylor Swift has a list so long of demands that it almost seems like a grocery list. She has stated that if she arrives at the event before 11 am she wants to have her Starbucks waiting for her. If you have ever wondered what her Starbucks order is then write down, one Grande Iced Caramel Latte with two Sweet'n Lows as well as one grande Americano with two&nbsp;Sweet'n Lows with soy milk and add on one slice of pumpkin loaf. She apparently likes to make Kraft Dinner when she’s on tour so there better be three boxes of that as well.</p><p><strong>Her demands are a little bizarre and resemble the sort of thing you would expect from a frat house.</strong></p><p>In her dressing room she requires "one stick butter for her mac and cheese, eight can of Red Bull, 12 pack Corona beer, 12 Pack Newcastle beer, one bottle of Welch’s grape juice, one avocado, one case of Smart water, one bag of Twizzlers licorice, one pint of Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream and one pint Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Brownie Frozen Yogurt."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-carnations-for-katy-perry><strong>No Carnations For Katy Perry</strong></h2><p>Like we said some celebrities don’t necessarily have demands for what they want in the room but more demands of what they don’t want around them. Katy Perry loves flowers especially if they are pink. In fact, the best thing you could do is get her a big bouquet of pink and white roses. If you are thinking of saving a buck though and go with carnations instead, you are not going to make her happy.</p><p><strong>She’s even been known to accept peonies, purple hydrangeas, and even seasonal white flowers. Just don’t go anywhere near carnations.</strong></p><p>Her other demands in the dressing room include “freeze-dried strawberries, six Vitamin Waters, baked tortilla chips, Huggies baby wipes, Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio, a jar of salsa, a big bowl of organic fruit, Snyder's of Hanover Honey Mustard and Onion Pretzels and plastic drinking straws.”</p><h2 id=britney-spears-wants-a-picture-of-princess-diana><strong>Britney Spears Wants A Picture Of Princess Diana</strong></h2><p>We all have our favorite legends, the people that we respect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Britney Spears is particularly obsessed with Princess Diana because one of her dressing room requests is that she wants a framed picture of the princess in her room.</strong></p><p>During a London 02 Arena show in 2011 that was part of her request list for her dressing room. She seems to have wanted a British flare to her travels because she also requested fish and chips to be brought to her room. She also demanded McDonald’s cheeseburgers sans buns, though she probably didn’t have to worry about the extra carbs when she burns so many calories due to her routine. Spears has always had a thing for cheeseburgers and when she wants them, she expects them to be there.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell-s-bizarre-demands><strong>Will Ferrell’s Bizarre Demands</strong></h2><p>We know that Will Ferrell is nowhere near a diva, so there is a chance that his demands were a big joke. He certainly likes to pretend that he is someone on a high horse, but that’s not who he is at all. If he made any demands, it would probably be pretty realistic ones. If not, then he probably got quite a surprise when he arrived on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>One time he made demands that included a three-wheeled electric scooter, a “Janet Jackson-style” headset microphone, a rainbow on wheels, an artificial tree, and of course a six-foot flight of rolling stairs.</strong></p><p>We’re sure that his demands were turned down. Well, maybe not the rainbow on wheels, they probably brought that one right on set for him. Does anyone know where you can buy a rainbow on wheels?</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera-needs-a-masseuse><strong>Christina Aguilera Needs A Masseuse</strong></h2><p>Don’t we all? When it comes to her time on The Voice, Christina Aguilera went into full diva mode. She required a masseur to come and take care of her feet while she was on set. Which is really weird since the stars are sitting the entire time they are on the show. It’s not like she stood on her feet all day. That was a pretty big diva move on her part, but that’s not the end of it.</p><p><strong>She also requested votive candles, soy cheese, dried cranberries, Nesquik, Flintstone vitamins, and an organic food tray prepared without Styrofoam or plastic.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are definitely some bizarre choices here, especially the Flintstone vitamins. Why would she need something so childish in her dressing room? Surely, she is taking adult vitamins by now.</p><h2 id=eminem-wants-a-koi-pond><strong>Eminem Wants A Koi Pond</strong></h2><p>Eminem is a pretty laidback singer, so we don’t expect any bizarre diva requests from him. But he did once ask for a full koi pond when he performed in Ireland. For the most part, he asks for things like free weights, so he can work out while he has his downtime. He requests a CD player so that he can play burned CDs because he’s old school like that.</p><p><strong>He also has an obsession with Lunchables which is probably the least healthy thing someone could eat.</strong></p><p>On top of that, he wants a lot of Diet Coke cans, two cases of Dasani water (never Evian), 6 cans of ginger ale, one loaf of bread, six cans of Red Bull, six Lunchables snacks (3 turkeys and 3 ham with cheese), large fresh jumbo shrimps with cocktail sauce, plenty of lemons, and one jar of banana pepper rings. His heartburn must be so bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alicia-keys-likes-room-temperature-water><strong>Alicia Keys Likes Room Temperature Water</strong></h2><p>We’re not sure why anyone would want to drink warm water, why not have a cool refreshing glass of water? Alicia Keys likes her water warm and she would prefer it to be Aquafina or Evian. She also wants tuna sandwiches, fish, vegetables, and chocolate almond milk.</p><p><strong>Like a few other celebrities, Keys wants seven sets of metal silverware to be sent to her dressing room.</strong></p><p>Her other requests include one lighter, three Glade candles (French Vanilla, Rain shower, Wild Berry, or Tangerine Ginger), ten Nutri-Grain bars (blueberry, cherry, apple, and strawberry), two cases of beer, as well as three menus for local seafood and Italian restaurants for the star to order from. A lot of these celebrities require a lot of food in their dressing room, but many of them come with entourages as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga-wants-white-leather-couches><strong>Lady Gaga Wants White Leather Couches</strong></h2><p>Her demands sound a little similar to Lopez' demands. We understand that being on tour can’t always be fun. You’re not in the comfort of your own home and sometimes it can be a cramped feeling. Regardless of how luxurious a tour bus can be, it’s just not the same as being at home. We get it, but that doesn’t mean that you should request bizarre things in your dressing room. Like white leather couches. That seems a little much, but that’s what Lady Gaga wants.</p><p><strong>It’s a waste to have something like that brought in for one star, why can’t it just be a regular couch?</strong></p><p>Not only that but she also wants 28 bottles of water at room temperature. Is lukewarm water better for the singing voice?</p><h2 id=kate-moss-has-a-bad-habit><strong>Kate Moss&nbsp;Has A Bad Habit</strong></h2><p>Kate Moss is one of the legendary supermodels of her generation. She’s rich and famous and can pretty much get anything that she wants. That apparently includes creating her own smoking line. She’s not modelling any longer, at least not on the level that she once was, but that doesn’t stop her from making demands. She’s designing now and when she launched her range of Longchamp bags, Moss demanded that Selfridges build an entire smoking area for her. She was not about to give up her freedom to smoke for anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She also wanted champagne and scented candles at the event as well.</strong></p><p>We’re not sure if they built her the smoking area but do you see anyone saying no to that face? She’s definitely one of the more “diva” supermodels out there.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-likes-to-keep-his-pipes-healthy><strong>Justin Bieber Likes To Keep His Pipes Healthy</strong></h2><p>It’s obviously pretty important for a singer to take care of his singing voice. The pipes have to be kept in proper working order, or a career can go downhill pretty quickly. When Justin Bieber is on tour, he wants plenty of herbal teas in his dressing room to keep those singing pipes perfectly sound the entire time. He also likes to snack, so he requests Ritz Bits in both cheese and peanut butter. If he’s hungry, he wants Swedish fish which doesn’t exactly make us hungry, but to each their own.</p><p><strong>Aside from that, Bieber has requested to have an assortment of low-rise socks and plain white t-shirts in his room.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you think that’s pretty low key for a celebrity, then keep in mind that he also doesn’t want anyone to speak to him directly, ever.</p><h2 id=naomi-campbell-demanded-her-flight-be-delayed><strong>Naomi Campbell Demanded Her Flight Be Delayed</strong></h2><p>Naomi Campbell is notorious for making demands and being a world-class diva. She was after all the girl that threw her phone at her assistant. We imagine that she would be an absolute nightmare to work for. Sometimes being rich and famous can get to some celebrity’s heads. In 2008, Campbell lost her bags and started to freak out.</p><p><strong>She ordered the airline to delay her flight from London to Los Angeles until the issue was resolved. You can just imagine how well that went.</strong></p><p>A company like that is unlikely to bow down to whatever ridiculous demands a celebrity comes up with, even if she is a supermodel. While on the movie set of The Face in 2014, she also informed the staff that they were not allowed to speak to her unless she spoke to them first. Wow, she is definitely one some pretty high horse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-shelton-likes-his-bbq><strong>Blake Shelton Likes His BBQ</strong></h2><p>Blake Shelton loves Gwen Stefani, but that doesn’t mean that he’s forgotten his country roots. That means that he likes to have a whole lot of goodies in his dressing room when he is on The Voice. His demands include light beer and Lays barbecue chips which are actually a pretty good combination. He also wanted beef jerky and Cheetos&nbsp;— this is clearly not a guy that worries about his diet.</p><p><strong>He definitely wants his dressing room stocked up&nbsp;and has quite the laundry list of items.</strong></p><p>Those include "one bag of Dunkin Donuts coffee, one bag espresso blend (Starbucks), four pack of 5-Hour-Energy, one case of Bud Light (cans only), one case of Miller Lite (cans only), two bottles of Bacardi Clear Rum, two bottles of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon), three packs of gum, and one bag of Hershey’s Chocolate Minis." We have to wonder if he’s even drunk while on the show with that menu.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna-wants-drapes-brought-in><strong>Rihanna Wants Drapes Brought In</strong></h2><p>Rihanna is another singer that has some ridiculous demands when it comes to her dressing room.</p><p><strong>She wants drapes brought in that are either black or blue, but she wants them to be layered with “icy-blue chiffon.”</strong></p><p>Seriously, who even thinks things like that up? She also requests that the room have an animal-print throw rug. She likes to have the lighting compliment a “relaxed atmosphere” as well as a humidifier. She has a particular taste in candles however and wants that request followed to a tee. She wants six Archipelago Black Forest candles and has specified that if they can not be found to check with her first before getting any other type of candle. She wants white drapes to be brought in to cover any bricks or lockers because she doesn’t want to see them. We can’t imagine why these celebrities don’t find their requests embarrassing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mccartney-s-requests-are-legendary><strong>Paul McCartney’s Requests Are Legendary</strong></h2><p>Paul McCartney is a pretty huge legend and with that comes major celebrity demands. He’s always been a huge animal rights supporter and because of that, he bans all fur, meat, and leather from his dressing room. He does love plants, however, so bringing in flowers is more than okay with him. His list of demands is long and they have a lot to do with animals. He doesn't want anything brought in that was made with anything that involves animals and that includes velour or denim.</p><p><strong>He wants all the lamps in the room to be halogen and to have a dimmer switch.</strong></p><p>He doesn’t even want to see artificial versions of animal skins or prints. He requests that a dry cleaner be available before his arrival and that’s not even the half of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-ivy-only-drinks-organic-milk><strong>Blue Ivy Only Drinks Organic Milk</strong></h2><p>Well, we’re not surprised considering the epic demands of her parents. This poor child is going to grow up expecting to receive anything that she asks for. She’s not even a celebrity, but you can bet that she will grow up to be one. It’s not really her fault; it’s her parents that seem to be setting her up to live an entitled lifestyle. Jay-Z is actually the one that puts in the demands for her.</p><p><strong>He only wants her to drink organic milk, though we doubt she would even know the difference.</strong></p><p>Wherever they go, Jay-Z demands that the room be childproofed and that include breakables&nbsp;being removed as well as lamps and statutes. Any sharp objects have to be removed and all electrical outlets must be covered. They may be going a little overboard, you can’t protect a child from everything, but it doesn’t look like they are taking their chances.</p><h2 id=madonna-wants-a-new-toilet-seat><strong>Madonna Wants A New Toilet Seat</strong></h2><p>Madonna is not into using anyone else’s toilet seats even if it is in a dressing room. We know that some toilets can be filthy, but we have to assume that a dressing room would be kept clean. Madonna doesn’t care how clean the room is; she knows how to get what she wants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>When she goes on tour, she doesn’t mess around and that means bringing along a 200-person entourage with her.</strong></p><p>She also requests that she has a brand-new toilet seat put in at every venue that she performs at. It happens for her and no one ever questions the ridiculous request. She also wants her own furniture from her home to be in her dressing room and she makes sure that it’s shipped there. If that isn’t diva behavior, then we don’t know what is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmp6pLHLnpmsZaeewal506GcZqWfqMFurcGsrKucXZmyrq3Nnapmnp%2BnerW0xKKpZpuYlruotc2gZKunn6J8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html&text=24%20Celebs%20With%20the%20Most%20Absurd%20Demands%20For%20Their%20Changing%20Room&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html&title=24%20Celebs%20With%20the%20Most%20Absurd%20Demands%20For%20Their%20Changing%20Room" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html&title=24%20Celebs%20With%20the%20Most%20Absurd%20Demands%20For%20Their%20Changing%20Room" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html&title=24%20Celebs%20With%20the%20Most%20Absurd%20Demands%20For%20Their%20Changing%20Room" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f24-celebs-with-the-most-absurd-demands-for-their-changing-room.html&description=24%20Celebs%20With%20the%20Most%20Absurd%20Demands%20For%20Their%20Changing%20Room" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./beyonc%C3%A9-s-new-era-gives-black-women-country-artists-bump-in-streams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonc's New Era Gives Black Women Country Artists Bump In Streams">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./15-pics-dana-white-doesn-t-want-you-to-see-of-these-ufc-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Pics Dana White Doesnt Want You To See Of These UFC Stars">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
