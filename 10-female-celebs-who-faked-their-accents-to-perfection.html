Money and fame are surely good, but the amount of dedication they have to put out for their crafts is insane. There are many cases where an actor has to bring a character to life, and let's be real, they don't always nail it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors Who Have Never Won An Oscar, Ranked By Nominations</a></span></p><p>However, these A-list performers are the exception. Not only did they always bring their best game to their works, but they also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">faked their accents</a> to perfection in the process. From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isla Fisher</a> to Meryl Streep, these are the ten actresses who managed to fake their accents perfectly.</p><h2 id=isla-fisher><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Isla Fisher</span></h2><p>Isla Fisher is an actress of many voices. Born in Australia, she mastered the posh British accent for her roles in Blithe Spirit. She even studied Downton Abbey to nail the 1930s posho-speak and would warm up her jaw for an hour during the set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As an Aussie doing a posh British accent whilst still trying to access the emotional life of the character was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a nerve-wracking experience</a>. Terrifying!," she recalled, as noted by Mirror.</p><h2 id=margot-robbie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Margot Robbie</span></h2><p>Before she was Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie possessed a strong Queenslander accent. Her Australian accent was so thick that the directors had to hire a dialect coach to make her sound "less Australian" for her part in Neighbours.</p><p>"So that was all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">part of the process of moving to America</a>. Before that the idea of being in Hollywood, I did think you had to be born into it or had to know someone in the industry," she told Vogue Australia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meghan-markle><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Meghan Markle</span></h2><p>There are many cases of celebrities losing their mother speech when they start living in another country or in another environment. Since <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan Markle</a></strong> involved herself in the British royal family and married <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Harry</a></strong>, she's slowly losing her American accent. The Suits actress' speech has gradually changed, and there are occasional vowels where she speaks more like a Brit.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> They're Not American? 15 Actors Who Have Accents</a></span></p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lindsay Lohan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay Lohan is a controversial queen, but her 2016 accent was something else. During the opening of a nightclub in Greece, the Mean Girls actress debuted her "sudden" foreign accent out of nowhere. According to her, she gradually picks up the speech whenever she learns a new language, and that's how it happens.</p><p>"I'm fluent in English and French, can understand Russian and am learning Turkish, Italian and Arabic," she said.</p><h2 id=katherine-langford><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Katherine Langford</span></h2><p>Another one from the Down Under. Many may have not known that Katherine Langford, the actress behind Hannah Baker in 13 Reasons Why, is a true Aussie. It's hard to believe, because she sounds really American on her Hollywood breakthrough role with 13 Reasons Why. She told Jimmy Kimmel that she learned by watching actors and constant vocal training.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=toni-collette><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Toni Collette</span></h2><p>Toni Collette is never shy when it comes to reaching new territories to perfect the crafts she works on, even if it means learning a whole new accent. Last year, the Aussie star picked up the Welsh accent for her roles in Dream Horse, which she admitted to being "incredibly intimidating."</p><p>"I have a fantastic dialect coach. But I was surrounded by the sounds that I was meant to be making, the rest of the cast the crew. I felt very supported," she told director Kevin Smith in an <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>.</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Millie Bobby Brown</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Millie Bobby Brown has been "Americanized" so hard that she even admitted struggling to speak with her original British accent. For her title role in Enola Holmes, which is set in Victorian London, she found that playing an American character for five years in Stranger Things had taken a toll on her true British identity.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Millie Bobby Brown Reveals She Learned An American Accent By Watching Hannah Montana</a></span></p><h2 id=madonna><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Madonna</span></h2><p>During her marriage to Guy Ritchie, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a></strong>, a Michigan native, was accused of faking a British accent. Her time of living together with the Sherlock Holmes director in the UK had made her accent a lot stronger. After their 2008 divorce, she gradually lost her accent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I didn’t know what anyone was talking about until I heard old interviews of myself. And then <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I was horrified and flabbergasted</a>. Why did you let me do that to myself? I’m from Michigan!," she told BBC.</p><h2 id=meryl-streep><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Meryl Streep</span></h2><p>Meryl Streep is a versatile actress of many voices, and she always makes accents as her playground. The American flaunts her British, Irish, Australian, Yiddish, and Polish accents extremely well. She's the true definition of a masterpiece of mimicry and she pushes the limit of what can an actor or an actress do for their roles.</p><h2 id=eliza-taylor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Eliza Taylor</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in Melbourne, Australia, Eliza Taylor shot to stardom for portraying an American character on The 100. She was famous in her home country for portraying Janae Timmins on the soap opera Neighbours from 2005 until 2008. She's so fantastic at what she does that it's almost impossible to believe that she possesses a thick Australian accent in her everyday life.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 10 Actors Who Can Hide Their Accents Flawlessly</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWmrqiuMRmmp6klZfAbsPHqGSfmZuasW7Ax56gq2WRmLCmutOsZK2nXaWys7LEnKuip55k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html&text=10%20Female%20Celebs%20Who%20Faked%20Their%20Accents%20To%20Perfection&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html&title=10%20Female%20Celebs%20Who%20Faked%20Their%20Accents%20To%20Perfection" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html&title=10%20Female%20Celebs%20Who%20Faked%20Their%20Accents%20To%20Perfection" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html&title=10%20Female%20Celebs%20Who%20Faked%20Their%20Accents%20To%20Perfection" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-female-celebs-who-faked-their-accents-to-perfection.html&description=10%20Female%20Celebs%20Who%20Faked%20Their%20Accents%20To%20Perfection" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-crazy-celebs-who-attacked-their-assistants.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Crazy Celebs Who Attacked Their Assistants">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-is-selena-gomez-one-of-the-most-followed-instagram-celebs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Selena Gomez One Of The Most-Followed Instagram Celebs?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
