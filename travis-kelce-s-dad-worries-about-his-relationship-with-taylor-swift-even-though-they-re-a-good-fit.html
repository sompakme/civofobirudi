Ed Kelce, Travis' dad, recently spoke about it, and while he had nothing but good things to say about the couple, and about Taylor especially, he still shared his worries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-kelce-39-s-dad-ed-likes-worries-about-his-son-39-s-newfound-popularity>Travis Kelce's Dad Ed Likes Worries About His Son's Newfound Popularity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/travis-kelce-and-mom.jpg><p>Travis Kelce's family had to get used to a lot in the past few months. If they thought they knew what fame was, they quickly realized they had only seen a small part of it. While Travis and Jason Kelce are both big in the football world, now that Travis is dating a world-famous pop star, they have found a new level of popularity that is not always easy to deal with.</p><p>Ed Kelce spoke about his feelings regarding the relationship, and how, as much as he likes Taylor Swift, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he still worries about this new level of fame and the dangers it poses</a>.</p><p>"<strong>I won’t pretend that I don’t worry about it, he is my son, and I worry about him because they will have some challenges in their relationship for sure</strong>," he explained candidly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These concerns are not unfounded, as Jason Kelce explained recently. <strong>At the beginning of Travis and Taylor's relationship, <a href=#>the Kansas City Chiefs player had to leave his own home because of stalkers</a></strong>, some of whom even followed him to the house he moved into.</p><h2 id=travis-39-dad-adores-taylor-swift-anyway-and-thinks-they-are-39-a-good-fit-39>Travis' Dad Adores Taylor Swift Anyway, And Thinks They Are 'A Good Fit'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-2024-grammys-1.jpg><p>Despite all these concerns, the Kelce family has quickly grown to love Taylor Swift. Ed Kelce was sure to make that clear, so people wouldn't think he didn't approve of the relationship or the singer.</p><p><strong>The father shared that he was impressed with her because she's "probably the most famous person in the world," and still "so warm and gracious" in every situation</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's also happy they share a passion for sports.

She didn't get the spoiled musician. She doesn't know how to pull that off.
