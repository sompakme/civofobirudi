It’s not until you see them with their men that you take a step back and realize that these women are&nbsp;très petite! They definitely make interesting pictures when they stand beside their, oftentimes, very tall husbands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether it’s actresses, musicians, or just celebrities, these are some of the smallest women in the industry. It’s surprising because some of these women have big personalities and some of them are badasses, so it takes you by surprise when you realize just how little they are. Most of these women are under 5 feet!</p><p>It’s funny when you see Jada Pinkett Smith beside her handsome husband, Will Smith, that’s when the real height difference comes into effect. These ladies are so petite, they could easily go into the children’s clothing line and save a buck or two.&nbsp;Check out these 15 celebs who are so petite that they could save money by purchasing kids’ clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lady-gaga-is-5-1><strong>Lady Gaga Is&nbsp;5’1"</strong></h2><p>It’s hard to tell sometimes how tall Lady Gaga is because her clothing is often very distracting. You probably didn’t even consider her height when you were staring at her meat outfit. She is known to wear some of the most bizarre outfits on the red carpet and maybe at the end of the day, she is trying to distract us from the fact that she is only 5’1.” It’s hard to believe considering what an amazing powerhouse this woman is when she’s on stage, but it’s true. Of course, when she is wearing those insanely high-heel shoes, it's really hard to tell how tall she is. The secret is out, however, and she’s not able to hide it any longer. It’s not surprising that we never see her in flats, ever! We understand why, she would look like a little girl if she did.</p><h2 id=ellen-page-is-5-1><strong>Ellen Page Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>Ellen Page became a Hollywood name after&nbsp;Juno and she’s been a hit ever since. It was pretty obvious right from the get-go that she was a pretty small human. She was cute as a button with a big pregnant belly in that movie and since then, she has been in movies with some big names like Leonardo DiCaprio. She recently was in the remake of Flatliners, a movie that was made famous by Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland. Even all dolled-up, she still looks like a little kid. She stands at 5’1” tall and she will probably always look young because of her height. She's also been quite the advocate for LGBTQ. Despite her height, she commands a lot of attention when she is on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jada-pinkett-smith-is-5-0><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith Is&nbsp;5'0"</strong></h2><p>As soon as Jada Pinkett Smith opens her mouth, you will likely forget that she’s a petite woman. She is another powerhouse in Hollywood that has always given us the impression that she’s a total badass. So, it comes as a shock to us that she is only 5'0" tall. She is, of course, married to the very tall Will Smith who is 6’2.” It’s hard to believe when you watch movies like The Matrix Reloaded that this girl is as small as she is. She’s been a spitfire in most of the roles that she plays, so there is a lot of fire in such a small body. Even in heels, Will still manages to tower over her. Her son Jaden also towers over his mother and we’ll have to see if Willow will also follow in her father’s footsteps when it comes to height.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-is-5-1><strong>Reese Witherspoon Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>This photo is almost funny to look at. Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman are in a TV show together and their height isn’t that obvious on the show. But standing side by side and the two seem unbelievable out of sync. There are ways of fooling the eyes on TV, but not so much in real life. Witherspoon is only 5’1” while Nicole Kidman is 5’11.” Nicole Kidman would often have to wear flats when she was married to Tom Cruise because he was shorter than her. It’s hard to believe that Witherspoon is so short, and she can thank the good camera work because it hasn’t been made that obvious to us at all. We would have thought that Legally Blonde would have exposed her height, but none of her roles have ever made it obvious. Considering one of her costars was the very tall Vince Vaugh, we should have realized it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-kendrick-is-5-0><strong>Anna Kendrick Is&nbsp;5’0”</strong></h2><p>Anna Kendrick has certainly come a long way from her role on Twilight. She is a force to be reckoned with these days and she’s&nbsp;acted alongside some serious talent. Kendrick is quite tiny, just look at this photo of her and Ryan Reynolds together, she looks like a little kid. Despite her firecracker personality, Kendrick is only 5’0.”&nbsp;Thank goodness for her big personality or we might not even notice her. She is making a big name for herself in Hollywood these days and considering she was one of the non-major costars on Twilight,&nbsp;she is just as famous now as Kristen Stewart. Some would argue that she's even bigger.&nbsp;Not only can this girl act, but she&nbsp;also has quite the voice, which we have seen in the many Pitch Perfect movies. We look forward to seeing what this petite actress has in store for us in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-bell-is-5-1><strong>Kristen Bell Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>This petite actress is another one that is known for being short, but she doesn’t let that stop her one bit. She's been stealing the show in movies for years and we don’t see that stopping anytime soon. She stands at 5’1” and her husband Dax Shepard is 6’2” tall. It’s funny how these ultra-short actresses always end up with super tall men. They could easily date a shorter man and they would still be shorter than them. But maybe they like feeling like they have a superhero by their side. Her role as Veronica in Veronica Mars didn’t hide the fact that she was short, but instead, they embraced it. Her character was able to sneak around undetected and also fit into small areas when it was time to hide. So, sometimes, being short works out in the end.</p><h2 id=paula-abdul-is-5-0><strong>Paula Abdul Is&nbsp;5’0”</strong></h2><p>We don’t see a whole lot of Paula Abdul these days, despite her awesome singing voice. She used to be on American Idol, but she doesn’t do that anymore. She may have only been on the show to make Ryan Seacrest appear taller. She decided to get her singing career back on and has been working toward that. She also received the Harry Chapin Memorial Humanitarian Award 2017 for her work with young people with the organization We.org. She has had a strong career in the music industry and throughout it, we had no idea that the singer was so petite. She is only 5’0” and yet, she has a powerhouse voice to her. She is dedicated to music in all aspects of life and we look forward to seeing what her new burgeoning singing career has to offer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hayden-panettiere-is-5-0><strong>Hayden Panettiere Is 5’0"</strong></h2><p>Hayden Panettiere is another powerhouse in Hollywood and she has been in the industry since she was a kid. Seriously, you have to look up old Law & Order: SVU episodes and you will see how cute she was as a little girl. She is still doing well in Hollywood as well as her personal life. You can see the actress on the popular TV show Nashville where she plays a famous country music star. It seems that her height hasn’t changed much and it becomes obvious how short she is when she is standing with her husband. This girl is for sure getting carded wherever she goes, look at how tiny she looks. She stands at 5’0” while her husband Wladimir Klitschko is a whopping 6’6.” She can be rest assured this giant has her back no matter where they go — he could be her bodyguard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-is-5-1><strong>Ariana Grande Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>This girl has a hell of a voice on her for such a petite girl. She started out as a Disney actress, but she also had some serious vocals. She was on the hit show Sam & Cat and&nbsp;while it was only on air for a year, there were a few spinoffs to the show. We are so glad that Ariana ditched the bright red hair, it just didn’t suit her. It wasn’t long before she was breaking music records all over the world. She stands at only 5’1” tall and that’s hard to believe when you hear her belt out her tunes on stage. She has a huge range and you really start to wonder where it’s coming from because she’s so small.</p><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-is-5-1><strong>Kourtney Kardashian Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>Kourtney Kardashian seriously needs some heels when she goes out with her new boyfriend, Younes Bendjima. Whenever she goes out with her man, it’s obvious just how short this girl really is. The two have been linked together for a while now so we can breathe a sigh of relief that she won’t be getting back together with Scott Disick. She is only 5’1” and her boyfriend clearly towers over her. They look cute together and despite the 14-year age difference, the two seem very happy together. He is a former boxer and now works as a model. The two met during fashion week in Paris last October and they have been steaming up pictures ever since. We hope it all works out for the reality star because she hasn’t had it easy in the relationship department.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-minogue-is-5-0><strong>Kylie Minogue Is&nbsp;5'0"</strong></h2><p>Kylie Minogue has had a pretty great career for over 25 years. She became a pop star after her role as Charlene in Neighbours. She has had a lot of success over the years and she’s barely aged a day. She might be able to attribute her youthful appearance to her height. She is quite petite being only 5'0."&nbsp;She’s originally from Australia, but she is considered a national treasure in the United States because of her successful career. She is a big supporter of getting tested early for breast cancer considering she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. She wrote a single last year that exposed her cheating ex-boyfriend, Joshua Sasse, for who he was. Her heart was broken after she found out her love was cheating on her. We look forward to hearing the new album that is said to be released this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tila-tequila-is-4-11><strong>Tila Tequila Is&nbsp;4’11”</strong></h2><p>Tila Tequila is one controversial reality TV star and she’s the type that never apologizes for her behavior. She is quite small, probably the smallest star that we’ve seen yet. She stands at 4’11” tall and that’s quite shocking. She has a larger than life personality, so we’ve never thought she was a petite girl. She has always looked like a little doll and she has no problem showing off her goodies wherever she goes. She was recently on Celebrity Big Brother and got booted off the show for sharing Nazi content and she also told viewers that she was responsible for a porn star's death because she prayed for it. It’s hard to tell if the reality TV star has lost her mind these days or if she’s trying to stay relevant. Only time will tell with this one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-is-5-0-and-ashley-olsen-is-5-1><strong>Mary-Kate Olsen Is 5'0" And Ashley Olsen Is 5'1"</strong></h2><p>These twins grew to fame after they starred in Full House as children. They banked millions as child stars before they gave up acting and started designing clothing. They are now in the fashion industry and have said goodbye to acting. They wouldn’t even go back to appear in the new Fuller House when asked, as it’s just not for them any longer. Despite the strange behavior of these twins over the years, they are well-known in the fashion industry and they are both very wealthy. You might not be aware that the twins have a younger sibling,&nbsp;Elizabeth Olsen, who is in the industry. You may recognize her from the Avengers. Elizabeth towers over the twins who are much smaller. Mary Kate is 5’0” while Ashley is an inch taller. We guess they aren’t identical after all. "I think they’ve given me a lot of little advice along the way,” Elizabeth told Us Weekly. The twins have recommended "people to work with" for their sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=annasophia-robb-is-5-0><strong>AnnaSophia Robb Is&nbsp;5’0”</strong></h2><p>AnnaSophia Robb is absolutely adorable. She is truly a talented and beautiful actress. She was the lucky girl that got to play a young Carrie Bradshaw in the TV show The Carrie Diaries. As you can see here, she was on set playing the fashionista. Just look at that outfit, the fashion alone is enough of a reason to love the show. We can also see that the young actress is only 5’0” tall, but we won’t hold that against her. She has come a long way in Hollywood since she played in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Although The Carrie Diaries didn’t have the same popularity as Sex and the City, Robb moved on to another TV show called Mercy Street. She’s certainly one actress that we should watch out for because we have a feeling that her career has only begun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens-is-5-1><strong>Vanessa Hudgens Is&nbsp;5’1”</strong></h2><p>Vanessa Hudgens is another beautiful actress that has a ton of talent, but not a ton of height. We never really noticed the difference when she was dating Zac Efron, but that was because her beau wasn’t very tall himself. Efron stands at about 5’8” tall. This is one actress that doesn’t date super tall men for some reason. Most of her exes turn out to be short men. She also dated Josh Hutcherson, who was even shorter than Efron at 5’7.” She is pretty tiny herself and she is only 5’1."&nbsp;We first saw Hudgens in the many High School Musical movies and that was where she found her first love, Efron, as well. Since then, she has been trying to shake the good-girl persona she adapted from those movies and has been in some pretty gritty flicks recently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZiyrbHBrGSsp12lsrW1055kraCVrnq0rdWeZKannprGbq7UsqCnn12gtqW%2FjJ%2BYrKCZpLtur8uoq6Gdo2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html&text=15%20Celebs%20So%20Petite%2c%20They%20Can%20Save%20Money%20Buying%20Kids%27%20Clothes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html&title=15%20Celebs%20So%20Petite%2c%20They%20Can%20Save%20Money%20Buying%20Kids%27%20Clothes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html&title=15%20Celebs%20So%20Petite%2c%20They%20Can%20Save%20Money%20Buying%20Kids%27%20Clothes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html&title=15%20Celebs%20So%20Petite%2c%20They%20Can%20Save%20Money%20Buying%20Kids%27%20Clothes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-celebs-so-petite-they-can-save-money-buying-kids-clothes.html&description=15%20Celebs%20So%20Petite%2c%20They%20Can%20Save%20Money%20Buying%20Kids%27%20Clothes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bruce-willis-emma-heming-s-adorable-family-moments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bruce Willis, Emma Hemings Adorable Family Moments">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./violet-baudelaire-in-a-series-of-unfortunate-events-memba-her.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Violet Baudelaire In 'A Series Of Unfortunate Events' 'Memba Her?!
