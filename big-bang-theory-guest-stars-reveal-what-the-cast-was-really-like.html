With their genuine on-screen chemistry, ability to play off of each other, and the hope that they’re friends in real life, these are the characters that made us fall in love with the show in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But intermixed with the regular cast, The Big Bang Theory has hosted dozens of high-profile guest stars. From world-renowned scientists to sci-fi favorites to some of Hollywood’s most respected actors, The Big Bang Theory seems to be a favorite on which to guest star.</p><p>Of the many guest stars the show had in 12 seasons, here’s what 8 of them said about their time on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Gates' 'Big Bang Theory' Appearance Was Based On A True Story</a></span></p><h2 id=stephen-hawking><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Stephen Hawking</span></h2><p>One of the most illustrious guest stars the show had was Stephen Hawking, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared on the show a total of seven times</a>. Reportedly, Hawking was a big fan of the hit sitcom. He was so invested, he even asked to see the rehearsal for the episodes on which he guest-starred once his part was filmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the actual appearances of Professor Hawking, there were several occasions when the cast was asked to mimic his computerized voice. Doing so made some of the cast uncomfortable, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">insiders say Hawking seemed to enjoy the homage</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Big Bang Cast And Other Celebs Pay Tribute To Stephen Hawking</a></span></p><h2 id=levar-burton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>LeVar Burton</span></h2><p>Known for his iconic role on Star Trek: The Next Generation, LeVar Burton was one of the sci-fi legends that guest-starred on the show. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke about the experience in an interview in 2012</a>, noting how enjoyable it was to reconnect with other Star Trek: The Next Generation stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The Big Bang Theory… I loved that,” Burton said. “It was fantastical fun, especially the most recent one, with Will Wheaton.”</p><p>Despite the high praise, Burton acknowledged the challenge that comes with playing yourself, even for a guest appearance. However, he couldn’t help but admit enjoying it.</p><p>“That’s what’s so great about it. I just get to be me,” he said.</p><h2 id=james-earl-jones><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Earl Jones</span></h2><p>Best known for portraying one of the sci-fi world’s greatest villains of all time, Darth Vader, James Earl Jones had his characteristic presence during his guest star appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the show’s 149th episode</a>, we see the characters desperately trying to attend <a href=#>Comic-Con</a>. When it looks like they won’t be able to make it. Sheldon decides to create his own convention and attempts to land some major actors for his celebrity appearances. One of those he approaches is James Earl Jones, who quickly takes a liking to Sheldon. This budding friendship leads to the two palling around town together for an episode.</p><p>Speaking <a href=#>about the appearance, Jones said</a>, for him, it was a “big thrill” to have the chance to work with Jim Parsons, who plays Sheldon. This is another testament to the incredible writing that led us to fall in love with the characters.</p><h2 id=katee-sackhoff><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Katee Sackhoff</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Katee-Sackhoff-The-Flash-Villain.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though we only see Katie Sackhoff for two brief appearances, both of which as a figment of the imagination of Howard Wolowitz, the experience was memorable, both for her and for the show. In one appearance, she teams up with George Takei to convince Howard to chase Bernadette.</p><p>“[The show] really… helped me decide that I could do [comedy],” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she explained</a>. “So when [<a href=#>Chuck Lorre</a>] called to see if I could do a second episode, I said, ‘Of course’.”</p><p>Clearly, the time spent guest starring on the show had a lasting impact on Sackhoff and her scenes with Takei are some of the most memorable and plot-moving of the series.</p><h2 id=bob-newhart><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bob Newhart</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bob-Newhart.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Playing the part of Professor Proton, a children’s science character within the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Newhart</a> had a strong, albeit short, a guest appearance that snowballed into him appearing in additional episodes.</p><p>Newhart is no novice. He’s a Golden Globe winner with around 60 years in the industry. And still, he decided to bring his deadpan delivery to the show’s brilliant script multiple times.</p><p>Describing his experience guest-starring on The Big Bang Theory, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newhart said it was like “going back in time”</a> to his earlier sitcom years. His presence was so beloved that he was invited to guest star on The Big Bang Theory’s spinoff sitcom, Young Sheldon.</p><h2 id=bill-nye><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Bill Nye</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bill-nye-is-an-inventor-.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every millennial knows the song and remembers watching Bill Nye The Science Guy as a kid. In a great move to better connect with their audience, Bill Nye was brought on to guest star in the series. And according to him, he was the one doing the chasing. He told Entertainment Weekly about how he ended up on the show.</p><p>“First of all, I’ve been pleading and interacting with those people for a couple of years, suggesting that I might be useful to the show and might fit in somehow,” Nye explained. “The other thing is I think my Twitter following got high enough where they decided to put me on.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Of the experience, Nye said</a>, “There’s a lot of very good actors, but the writing is the hard part. And the writing on Big Bang is something else. Everybody [on the cast] really helped me. They really wanted everyone to succeed; it was nice.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Nye Reveals How He Got The Role Of Sinclair In David Fincher's 'Mank'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-west><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Adam West</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/adam-west-as-batman.jpg><p>An icon in the superhero world of Hollywood is Adam West, the OG Batman - literally, the first one! Landing West as a guest star on the show was a big deal to the cast and crew, but it was also significant to him because it was The Big Bang Theory’s 200th episode, which happened to fall on the 50th anniversary of Batman.</p><p>“It’s wonderful,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told Variety</a>. “For years, I thought, oh, they’re just ignoring me. They don’t want me around. And then I find out that they waited for the 200th anniversary show, knowing, I think, too, that it’s Batman’s 50th anniversary.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-hamill><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mark Hamill</span></h2><p>Another Hollywood heavy hitter from the <a href=#>Star Wars</a> franchise, <a href=#>Mark Hamil</a>l was not forgotten. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a report by the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Hamil was a little uneasy to accept the offer for a guest star appearance because there wasn’t a script yet for him to review.</p><p>The showrunner for The Big Bang Theory, Steve Holland, discussed Hamill’s appearance with the Hollywood Reporter, recalling Hamil came to the show and talked with the writing team and cast for several hours.</p><p>“We had a good time together,” Holland said, “and he luckily decided to trust us and take a leap of faith. He signed on without seeing word one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This speaks highly of the writing on The Big Bang Theory. It proves the shows consistent quality that Hamil could look to as a consideration in signing on to appear in a script without seeing it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This One Important Character Was Originally Not Part Of 'The Big Bang Theory'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZop9dl66vs4ytn56noq56qMHErKtmq6SWv7R50Z6tnpmcYsSprdNmq6GdXZiutMCMsJisZaKarq242GajoqOVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html&text=%27Big%20Bang%20Theory%27%3a%20Guest%20Stars%20Reveal%20What%20The%20Cast%20Was%20Really%20Like&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html&title=%27Big%20Bang%20Theory%27%3a%20Guest%20Stars%20Reveal%20What%20The%20Cast%20Was%20Really%20Like" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html&title=%27Big%20Bang%20Theory%27%3a%20Guest%20Stars%20Reveal%20What%20The%20Cast%20Was%20Really%20Like" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html&title=%27Big%20Bang%20Theory%27%3a%20Guest%20Stars%20Reveal%20What%20The%20Cast%20Was%20Really%20Like" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-bang-theory-guest-stars-reveal-what-the-cast-was-really-like.html&description=%27Big%20Bang%20Theory%27%3a%20Guest%20Stars%20Reveal%20What%20The%20Cast%20Was%20Really%20Like" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./i-can-t-wear-all-black.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="&amp;quot;I Can't Wear All Black?&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-alexa-penavega-left-hollywood-behind.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Alexa PenaVega Left Hollywood Behind">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
