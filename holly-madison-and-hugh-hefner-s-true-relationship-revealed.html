At the time, she was a 20-year-old college student and an aspiring actress, and she wasn't really exceling at any part of her life. She wasn't happy with her living situation, and upon being invited to move in, she assumed this was going to be an advantageous move to make, considering her state of affairs at the time. Nobody mentioned to her that being intimate with Hugh Hefner was a pre-requisite to living in the mansion, but that fact suddenly revealed itself, and before she knew it, Holly Madison was <a href=#>heavily immersed in the Playboy lifestyle.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Holly Madison's Life After The Playboy Mansion</a></span></p><h2 id=holly-madison-was-inebriated-during-her-encounters-with-hugh-hefner><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Holly Madison Was Inebriated During Her Encounters With Hugh Hefner</span></h2><p>Fans who have wondered whether or not sobriety is an issue in the Playboy mansion, need not worry anymore. Holly Madison admits that it was common for the girlfriends to be heavily inebriated and under the influence during their time at the house, and that in fact, this was precisely the case for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She says she was "always wasted" when she was intimate with Hugh Hefner, and that includes the very first time she engaged in intimate activities with him.

She described the way the girlfriends would be around Hugh Hefner in groups during intimate interactions, and how she eventually moved into his bedroom and began spending time with him one-on-one. She admitted their intimate time together wasn't enjoyable to her, but that she started to appreciate the times they would spend watching old movies together and how an emotional bond began to develop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holly-madison-felt-guilty-and-ashamed-and-was-afraid-to-leave-the-mansion><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Holly Madison Felt Guilty And Ashamed, And Was Afraid To Leave The Mansion</span></h2><p>One of the main reasons that Holly Madison remained in the mansion is the fact that she was feeling guity and ashamed for her actions. She felt that she had crossed a moral line that she had previously drawn for herself when she became intimate with Hugh, and she felt incredibly disgusted with herself. "I had locked myself into the situation in a way because of the shame involved," said Madison. She went on to declare that she started to feel that if she left it would be the same as being discarded, but if she stayed, there was a chance she could make something of this situation in some way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is â€˜Girls Next Doorâ€™ Holly Madison Worth Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holly-madison-began-assuming-a-39-wife-39-role-with-hugh-hefner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Holly Madison Began Assuming A 'Wife' Role With Hugh Hefner</span></h2><p>When Holly first moved into Hugh's bedroom and became his main girlfriend, she felt this to be a truly flattering role. She felt special and felt as though she was in a position of hierarchy over the other girlfriends. However, she soon realized what moving into Hugh's bedroom and being his main girlfriend actually involved. She was now forced to share one on one time with him at night and was essentially trapped with him while the other girls got to go out and enjoy life outside of the mansion. The other girlfriends became full of animosity towards her, and she soon became quite hated by the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holly-started-getting-attached-to-hugh-in-an-unhealthy-way><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Holly Started Getting Attached To Hugh In An Unhealthy Way</span></h2><p>Being one-on-one with Hugh Hefner changed the dynamics of their relationship very quickly. It wasn't long before Holly Madison felt that she was becoming increasingly attached to him. Unfortunately, her emotions weren't developing in a healthy way. She want on to describe her feelings by saying, "It was a very Stockholm syndrome kind of thing where I felt like I identified with him, he was complimenting me so much, I started in my mind started blaming all the other problems on the other women."</p><h2 id=holly-madison-became-deeply-depressed><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Holly Madison Became Deeply Depressed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holly Madison's lifestyle wasn't a sustainable one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She was always inebriated</a> and admitted that she was aware that her "brain was getting slower." She was feeling that she had no ambition or drive, and she was becoming deeply depressed. Holly indicated that she was given anti-depressants just before Girls Next Door aired, and she realized she was spiraling out of control. She even opened up to reveal that she became suicidal and became seriously emotionally disturbed. She says, "I think it was part of being nervous, partly doubting myself, partly being in this environment where I was always drinking and my mind was never stimulated."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Holly Madison And Hugh Hefner Never Had Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=her-relationship-with-hugh-caused-major-drama-with-the-girlfriends><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Relationship With Hugh Caused Major Drama With The Girlfriends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Holly Madison was pushed into being Hugh's main girlfriend because none of the other girls wanted to play that role. When she found a way to focus on the positive aspects, such as feeling special, soaking up Hugh's compliments, and enjoying movie nights together, Hugh perceived her as being obedient and well-behaved. When the other girlfriends would act in a manner that wasn't favorable, he would point out Holly's behavior as being "more desirable," and that led to a whole lot of animosity. They girls were catty towards one another. Holly said, "I was kind of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> always in fear of getting sabotaged by other women</a>, getting kicked out, him yelling at me or embarrassing me in front of other people."</p><h2 id=holly-madison-is-the-one-who-called-it-quits><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Holly Madison Is The One Who Called It Quits</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hugh Hefner wasn't able to have kids with Holly and pushed back at the thought of ever getting married. He wasn't interested in anything beyond the arrangement they already had, and Holly was becoming increasingly frustrated by her lifestyle. She really wanted to have children and was seeking a more normal lifestyle. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She wasn't happy with any aspect of her life in the mansion</a> and decided to break free from it all for good. She is the one that decided to leave Hugh, although she was guilt-ridden about doing so.
