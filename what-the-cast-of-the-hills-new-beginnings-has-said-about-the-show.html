Here is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what she told</a>Entertainment Tonight:</p><p>"I feel like Speidi's on the chopping block a lot. I think there were a lot of high emotions and a lot of heightened things going on for everybody, so I think we were an easy target for a lot of people."</p><h2 id=and-spencer-pratt-revealed-he-thinks-the-show-won-t-be-renewed><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>And Spencer Pratt Revealed He Thinks The Show Won't Be Renewed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with the Unpopular podcast, Spencer Pratt voiced his opinions on a potential third season of The Hills: New Beginnings.

I thought that it was shot really beautifully. Did I agree with the storylines and how they made me look? No, because it wasn’t true. This time around, I think it’s shot a little bit more quick to my liking. ... But I do agree with the storylines and basically what we’re saying and doing is coming out on TV.

An easy way for The Hills: New Beginnings to continue shooting would have been to put the cast in a house together. However, Brody Jenner told ET Canada that he thought that was a horrible idea. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Brody said</a>:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I wanted to keep it as authentic as possible to the original and I think The Hills was about Hollywood. Granted it was Lauren Conrad and she was working at Teen Vogue and doing all the fashion, so it’s a little different, but I just felt like going and filming in a bubble was just not ‘The Hills. I wanted to showcase what was really going on in our lives [this season]. Living in a house altogether is really not reality. None of us would ever do that in a million years.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stefanie did say</a> that the reboot is full of drama — and that's probably the reason she left:</p><p>"From the first five minutes, it’s just drama.
