A follow up to his 2020 EP F*ck The World, the 19-track project is executive produced by Jonathan “Freeze” Wells and features guest appearances from DJ Dahi and Tyler, the Creator on “Gravity”, and Alicia Keys on “Ghetto Gatsby”. The album also features Drake and The Neptunes on “Wasting Time”, Joony on “FYTB”, and Tre’ Amani on “Addictions”.Faiyaz released Wasteland on July 8. The singer is in the running to score his first number one album on the Billboard 200 chart. The<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> album is expected to sell between 105,000 - 115,000 units </a>in its first week, according to HitsDailyDouble. The chart predictors believe Wasteland will contend with Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti for the top spot. If successful this will make Brent the first independent artist since 2018 to achieve a number one album. It would also make him the first R&B act to debut atop the chart since Still Over It last November by Summer Walker, who announced <a href=#>she was quitting music back in 2020.</a> With his impending success, you are bound to hear the name Brent Faiyaz again.
