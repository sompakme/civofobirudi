Furthermore, he previously stated that evangelist Kathryn Kuhlman played a huge influence on how his life turned out. However, <strong>Dr. Winston I. Nunes taught pastor Benny the Bible</strong> and mentored him to be a pastor.</li><li>After learning the Bible, Benny moved to Orlando, FL where he started the <strong>Orlando Christian Center</strong> in 1983. It is in Orlando Christian Center that Benny began performing healing services claiming that God was using him as a healing vessel. His popularity increased greatly after he started holding&nbsp;Miracle Crusades in different stadiums in the US and the world.</li><li>Moreover, he started televising his miracle crusades in 1989. He also started the daily talk show <strong>This Is Your Day&nbsp;</strong>in 1990 which airs clips of Hinn’s Miracle Crusades. This Is Your Day was first aired on Trinity Broadcasting Network and ever since his ministry has grown to attract huge praises with equal criticism.</li></ul><ul><li>However, he stepped down as pastor of the Orlando Christian Center in 1999. He moved the Orlando Christian Center administrative headquarters to Grapevine, TX but hosts his daily 30-minute talk show <strong>This Is Your Day</strong> from a television studio in Orange County, CA. The World Healing Center Church mainly puts a focus on financial prosperity and is also behind the mission outreach programs.</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore, This Is Your Day is one of the world’s most-watched Christian shows.
