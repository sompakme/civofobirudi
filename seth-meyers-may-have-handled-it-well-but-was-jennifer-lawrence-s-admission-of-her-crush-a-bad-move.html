She went on the show and shared the story of a mildly humiliating moment: the time she had a crush on the host.</p><p>A lot of viewers found her story hilarious, and related to her more than they cared to admit. After all, who hasn't had an embarrassing crush, only to find out the person they like is unavailable? Jennifer spoke about it nonchalantly, obviously thinking it wouldn't be anything more than a funny anecdote in a talk show. But years later, people are still talking about it—and wondering if it was such a good idea for the secret to come out.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-admitted-her-previous-crush-on-seth-meyers>Jennifer Lawrence Admitted Her Previous Crush On Seth Meyers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jennifer-lawrence-waving-goodbye.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Lawrence's reveal of her crush on Seth Meyers will go down in history as one of the best confessions on a talk show ever. It didn't mean anything, of course, as her crush had long passed when she told the story, but it still caused waves.</p><p>"You probably know this by now because I've told everybody at NBC," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer began her story</a>. "Years ago, I did SNL. You were working there. I don't know what you did. I had a really big crush on you, and so I had this whole plan. All week I was like, 'He's going to ask me out. He's totally going to ask me out.' Then later in the week I was like, 'I'm going to ask him out.' I had created the romance in my head because I'm delusional," she laughed. "And so I was like, 'OK, you know what? I'm doing it. I'm doing it!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her plans didn't get very far, because she confided in someone beforehand and they stopped her before it could get awkward.</p><p>"Thank God I talked to the wardrobe lady and I was like, 'I think I'm going to ask Seth Meyers out. I'm going to give him my number.' She was like, 'Honey, he's engaged.' I was like, 'Cool! Good talk!' Ah!'"</p><p>She seemed unbothered while telling the story, summing up, "It was so long ago that now I feel like I could tell you."</p><h2 id=fans-were-not-impressed-with-jennifer-spilling-her-39-secret-39>Fans Were Not Impressed With Jennifer Spilling Her 'Secret'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seth-Meyers-Alexi-Ashe.jpg><p>At the time Jennifer told this story, Seth Meyers was expecting his first child with <a href=#>his wife of then two years, Alexi Ashe</a>. The couple married in 2013 after dating for five years, so needless to say, they were solid and in a really good place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seth felt the need to point this out when the conversation with Jennifer took place. Not because of her, mind you, because at no point did she say anything inappropriate. In fact, she made it perfectly clear that, even when she had a crush on him, she backed off as soon as she learned that he was in a relationship.</p><p>But he's a talk show host, and if he hadn't stated bluntly and unequivocally that he was happy with his wife, the rumors about him and Jennifer having an affair may have hounded his marriage for years.</p><p>"It's safe because it worked out, I married that lady," he said about it, and then added, "We should have had you do a toast at our wedding." He also gave cheers to "how everything worked out." "Cheers to my humiliation, I guess," Jennifer joked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This unmistakable display of loyalty, while necessary and sweet, didn't work too well for Jennifer Lawrence. Although it wasn't her intention at all, this funny story about what was an embarrassing moment for her brought her a lot of negative attention.</p><p>Some of the comments implied she might be trying something by revealing her secret that way. They also shamed her for wanting to ask out a man in a relationship (even though she didn't know at the time, and effectively gave up when she found out).</p><p>The nice comments seem to outweigh the nasty ones, though, since a lot of people correctly interpreted the situation as Jennifer making fun of a moment that embarrassed no one but herself. They found her funny and relatable in her failure to get a chance with her crush and didn't think anything of the 'secret.'</p><h2 id=many-commenters-thought-seth-meyers-reacted-appropriately-but-not-authentically>Many Commenters Thought Seth Meyers Reacted Appropriately, But Not Authentically</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jennifer-lawrence-and-seth-meyers-via-youtube-late-night-with-seth-meyers.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the things commenters were quick to point out and praise was Seth Meyers' reaction to Jennifer's confession. A lot of people compared this interview to the time <a href=#>Nicole Kidman shared the story of her failed date with Jimmy Fallon</a>.</p><p>He was beside himself when he found out that the time they hung out was actually a date, and that he'd had a real shot at dating the movie star and wasted it. All the while, he was married to the mother of his children.</p><p>As understandable as it is to be upset at missing a chance with Nicole Kidman, Jimmy didn't come off too well from that interview. Seth was the complete opposite. The whole time he laughed at the misunderstanding and did his best not to make Jennifer feel bad, but never once implied that he would have done anything differently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-31t185055-950.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence Admitted She Had Too Much To Drink On National Television During Her Interview With Stephen Colbert ">Jennifer Lawrence Admitted She Had Too Much To Drink On National Television During Her Interview With Stephen Colbert</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Lawrence and Stephen Colbert got extra comfortable with glasses of rum during their interview.</p><p><a href=#>His appropriate reaction received high praise</a>, but there were some comments that pointed out it might not be authentic.
