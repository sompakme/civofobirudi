The series takes place in 19th century England, following the story of Lords and Ladies, love and drama. This <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> original was produced by Shonda Rhimes, and fans are already eagerly awaiting season three.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is The 'Bridgerton' Spinoff Series Based On A Book?</a></span></p><p>One reason fans love the cast is because while they are all talented, the stars are mostly unknown. Because of their status prior to season one, many hit a major growth in their net worth between the releases of each season. Here is how the Bridgerton stars’ net worths changed from 2020 to 2022.</p><h2 id=simone-ashley-39-s-net-worth-increased-by-over-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Simone Ashley's Net Worth Increased By Over $2 Million</span></h2><p>Simone Ashley joined the Bridgerton set for season two, portraying the character “Kate Sharma.” While she was not part of the cast for season one, Simone was best known in 2020 for the Netflix series Sex Education. Her net worth at that time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was at approximately $200,000</a>, as she had only been cast fourteen times since 2016. The most recent update shows that her net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now between $2-3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicola-coughlan-over-doubled-her-700-000-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Nicola Coughlan Over Doubled Her $700,000 Net Worth</span></h2><p>While <a href=#>Irish actress Nicola Coughlan plays “Penelope Featherington”</a> in the show, the role that boosted her to stardom was through the TV series Derry Girls. She has been cast in fifteen works thus far, one being a movie that is still filming, and many of those roles have been on television shows. Her net worth for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season one of Bridgerton was around $700,000</a> but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rose to $2 million</a> after the release of season two.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Bridgerton' Star Nicola Coughlan Reacts To People Commenting On Her Body</a></span></p><h2 id=claudia-jessie-made-a-multi-million-dollar-leap-since-season-2><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Claudia Jessie Made A Multi-Million Dollar Leap Since Season 2</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Claudia Jessie plays young “Eloise Bridgerton,”</a> joining the cast in 2020. Before this job, she had worked on 25 other titles, such as the shows Vanity Fair, Dixi, and she even appeared on one episode of Doctor Who. Her net worth coming into the show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was around $900,000</a> thanks to her involvement in these productions over the last decade. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her net worth is now $5 million</a>, and she has three titles currently in the works.</p><h2 id=jonathan-bailey-added-half-a-million-to-his-1-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jonathan Bailey Added Half A Million To His $1 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may not have been a monumental increase, but Jonathan Bailey increased his net worth from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">approximately $1 million</a> in season one to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 million by the end of season two</a>. <a href=#>Bailey portrayed “Lord Anthony Bridgerton,”</a> one of the stars of the series, and came to the show with an impressive resume. Jonathan has acted in Sony’s 1985 Alice Through the Looking Glass, the Netflix film Sam, and an episode of Doctor Who. He is currently working on voicing a video game entitled Squadron 42.</p><h2 id=luke-thompson-doubled-his-1-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Luke Thompson Doubled His $1 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>Luke Thompson was hired to play “Benedict Bridgerton,” coming to the series with only ten titles on his resume. Prior to season one, Thompson had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 million net worth</a> thanks to his involvement in the film Dunkirk and the Shakespeare reenactments of Shakespeare’s Globe: A Midsummer Night’s Dream, The Complete Walk: Romeo and Juliet, and the 2018 production of Hamlet. In the last two years, Bridgerton has been the only project he’s worked on, bringing his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to $2 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What The Cast Members Of 'Bridgerton' Do In Their Free Time</a></span></p><h2 id=polly-walker-more-than-tripled-her-net-worth-of-1-5-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Polly Walker More Than Tripled Her Net Worth Of $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Polly Walker started acting in 1989, adding big productions like Clash of the Titans and Emma (starring Gwenyth Paltrow) to her resume over the years. She was cast as “Lady Portia Featherington” in Bridgerton and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a net worth of $1.5 million</a> when season one premiered. Since then, Walker has acted in two more TV shows entitled Cursed and Pennyworth, bringing her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth up to an impressive $5 million</a> at the beginning of this year.</p><h2 id=julie-andrews-lost-15-million-since-season-1-released><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Julie Andrews Lost $15 Million Since Season 1 Released</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julie Andrews is undoubtedly the most accomplished person hired for this hit series. While she is never seen, <a href=#>she was cast as “Lady Whistledown,” the narrator of the show</a>. She is the most well-known of the cast, although she has only been in 46 productions since the start of her career in 1949. Some of her most famous titles include The Sound of Music and the <a href=#><strong>Disney</strong></a> productions of The Princess Diaries and Marry Poppins. Her net worth dropped, however, from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$45 million in season one</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30 million this year</a>.</p><h2 id=golda-rosheuvel-had-the-largest-net-worth-growth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Golda Rosheuvel Had The Largest Net Worth Growth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most impressive net worth growth goes to Golda Rosheuvel, who plays “Queen Charlotte.” In the beginning of season one, Golda came into the series with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $2 million</a> after acting for two decades. When season two premiered, her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth totaled $15 million</a> thanks to not only her work in Bridgerton, but also the popularity of the film Dune. She is also currently filming a miniseries with Shonda Rhimes in which she will continue to act as “Queen Charlotte” in a story based off her character.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What The 'Bridgerton' Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6GUnLKzwM6nZKyskafAbrrErWSwp6KptW6%2FxJqqqKZdZnq3v4ynprBlnp6wsLjAZpqorZeduaK6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html&text=%27Bridgerton%27%3a%20The%20Stars%27%20Net%20Worth%20In%20Season%201%20Vs.%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html&title=%27Bridgerton%27%3a%20The%20Stars%27%20Net%20Worth%20In%20Season%201%20Vs.%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html&title=%27Bridgerton%27%3a%20The%20Stars%27%20Net%20Worth%20In%20Season%201%20Vs.%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html&title=%27Bridgerton%27%3a%20The%20Stars%27%20Net%20Worth%20In%20Season%201%20Vs.%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbridgerton-the-stars-net-worth-in-season-1-vs-now.html&description=%27Bridgerton%27%3a%20The%20Stars%27%20Net%20Worth%20In%20Season%201%20Vs.%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./red-white-and-royal-blue-movie-most-magical-scene-was-from-book.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Red, White and Royal Blue' Movie: Most 'Magical' Scene Was From Book">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tommy-dorfman-accuses-delta-staffer-of-misgendering-her.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tommy Dorfman Accuses Delta Staffer of Misgendering Her">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
