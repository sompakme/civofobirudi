It was due to <a href=#>his anti-vaccine stance</a>. At that time, <a href=#>Chet was also facing a $1 million lawsuit for multiple abuse charges filed by ex-girlfriend Kiana Parker</a>. For the longest time, fans have been trolling the famous offspring for continuously "embarrassing" his father. Chet's recent statement about <a href=#>the Forrest Gump star</a> also drew flak on social media. In a YouTube video, he claimed that his father's "toxic fame" made him "self-destructive." Here's how.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Actors Say Tom Hanks Is One Of The Best Work With</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-chet-hanks-famous-for>What Is Chet Hanks Famous For?</h2><p>Chet has gained notoriety for his problematic antics. Aside from his anti-vaccine opinions and abuse allegations, he had "a long journey," battling substance abuse. The self-proclaimed "black sheep" of the family has caught himself in serious troubles due to his addiction. One of which was rear-ending a car driven by Terry Moogan who then suffered "whiplash and a brain injury from hitting his head on the dashboard." It was in 2015, right before Chet entered rehab. He was reportedly driving a car registered to his parents and was "under the influence of drugs and or alcohol at the time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's also had feuds with multiple celebrities like <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> who said Tom must be "annoyed" at his "gangster" behavior. Chet responded by threatening the radio host. He said he'd "assault" him. He also got his dad involved in a 2020 feud with rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine. Later that year, Chet slammed for speaking in a Jamaican accent as he reacted to Joe Biden's presidential win.</p><p>A year later, <a href=#>Chet released a viral video for his brand White Boy Summer</a> — a play on Megan Thee Stallion's hit Hot Girl Summer. The cringe-fest was slammed. "I just got this feeling man... that this summer is, it's about to be a White Boy Summer," he said in the video. "Take it how you want. I'm not talking about Trump, NASCAR-type white. I'm talking about, you know, me, [R&B singer] Jon B, [rapper/singer] Jack Harlow-type white boy summer." Chet defended his brand, saying it's not about "having any ill will or prejudice toward anybody from a different background, race, walk of life." Fans didn't think so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Unbelievable Reason Why Nia Vardalos Hung Up On Tom Hanks</a></span></p><h2 id=chet-hanks-said-tom-hanks-39-39-toxic-fame-39-made-him-39-self-destructive-39>Chet Hanks Said Tom Hanks' 'Toxic Fame' Made Him 'Self-Destructive'</h2><p>In his recent vlog, Chet said that although he's "blessed" to have his parents, it's actually a "double-edged sword." <a href=#>Growing up, he had a hard time dealing with his father's fame</a>. "There's a lot of advantages but sometimes it can be pretty weird," he said of being <a href=#>the two-time Oscar winner</a>'s son. "I got to do a lot of cool s--- that a lot of people don't get the opportunity to do. I got to travel the world, stay in nice hotels, fly on private planes and I'm very blessed for that. I wouldn't change my situation." However, that came with "a lot of animosity and negativity" from other people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My experience was even more complicated because on top of fame already being toxic, I wasn't even famous," Chet added. "I was just the son of somebody famous so I hadn't even done anything to deserve any sort of recognition and that created a lot of contempt." He also claimed that "he didn't have a strong male role model" to tell him, "Bro, these people. They are just jealous of you. You have all these things that they want so they are trying to throw their shade at you so you can feel s--tty about yourself because they are jealous."</p><p>Fans defended Tom and said that he's a "quality" person, unlike Chet. They also refuse to believe that the latter has now "changed" and is no longer in "a path of self-destruction."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Was Tom Hanks Paid For ‘The Polar Express’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-39-s-chet-amp-tom-hanks-39-relationship-now>How's Chet & Tom Hanks' Relationship Now?</h2><p>Though Chet's parents cut him off financially, it doesn't mean they're no longer on speaking terms. After all, Tom and Rita have always supported their son through his ups and downs. "As a parent, you love your kids unconditionally," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Cast Away star told ET</a> of Chet's sobriety in 2015. "You support them every step of the way. You got to applaud the bravery and honesty when it actually comes out of your own house." Chet also feels "lucky" that his parents have "always been there" for him "every step of the way."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tom Hanks Saved His Career By Losing Out On This Box Office Disaster</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdna6vt9JmmqGdpGK1orrKrGScraKnsq%2FAjKucpZmknryvv8eip2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html&text=What%20Is%20Tom%20Hanks%20And%20His%20Son%20Chet%20Hanks%27%20Relationship%20Like%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html&title=What%20Is%20Tom%20Hanks%20And%20His%20Son%20Chet%20Hanks%27%20Relationship%20Like%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html&title=What%20Is%20Tom%20Hanks%20And%20His%20Son%20Chet%20Hanks%27%20Relationship%20Like%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html&title=What%20Is%20Tom%20Hanks%20And%20His%20Son%20Chet%20Hanks%27%20Relationship%20Like%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-tom-hanks-and-his-son-chet-hanks-relationship-like-now.html&description=What%20Is%20Tom%20Hanks%20And%20His%20Son%20Chet%20Hanks%27%20Relationship%20Like%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./when-does-baddies-east-auditions-come-out-june-release-date-announced.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Does Baddies East Auditions Come Out?
