Despite the fact that their shows take different approaches, they are both deeply beloved hosts. However, Wendy Williams has faced backlash and controversy over her approach and the way she treats her guests. She is known for her insensitive and sometimes rude comments, and that's caused her to receive a<a href=#> lot of pushback from celebrities and fans alike</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Montel Williams is one of Wendy Williams's peers who had an issue with the way she handled her show. In an interview with US Weekly the talk show host went into details about how he feels about Wendy's show, and he had nothing good to say.</p><h2 id=wendy-williams-a-history-of-controversy>Wendy Williams: A History Of Controversy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/st4.depositphotos.com/1694341/31576/i/600/depositphotos_315763122-stock-photo-wendy-williams-star-ceremony.jpg><p>Wendy Williams has been in the headlines for both her divorce and her ongoing battle with Graves Disease. She has a history of making comments about people's romantic life, health, and even deaths, which perhaps makes Montel's words warranted.</p><p>Most recently she was under fire for mocking the death of Tiktok star Matima Miller, better known as Swavy. On an episode of her show she said "I have no idea who this is. Neither does one person in this building." She then proceeded to compare followers with Miller on TikTok and Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't the first time that Williams has made unsavory comments toward the dead. When Amie Harwick was brutally murdered, she made a tasteless joke using the Price Is Right catchphrase and mimicking watching someone fall. Wendy has also made several faux pas related to people's battles with serious illnesses, like in 2006 when she leaked news about Method Man's wife Tamika Smith's battle with breast cancer.</p><p>Method man had a fiery response to this incident, " You don’t do that to nobody. You say what the **** you want to say about me, say nothing about my family,". Williams has made reference to people's spouses before, such as when she made a comment about Roseanne Barr's ex-husband Tom Arnold. Bar <a href=#>did not take her comment lying down and was quick to reply</a> "I don’t like talking about husbands . . . Right, Wendy?".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Roseanne isn't the first person to clap back at Wendy Williams. In 2020 the TV host took a shot at Dionne Warwick, saying, "She’s never been involved in the Twittersphere. She watches TV or she sings songs, or she reads books or she socializes, or she moisturizes her hair. I think if you’re a person of a particular age, you need to [be on] social media and you need to get down sometimes and talk at these kids. Not to them talk at them. But you do need somebody young in your family just to make sure that you’re coming off correct."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>15 Things Most People Don't Know About Wendy Williams' Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Warwick was quick to reply on Twitter. "A friend alerted me that Wendy Williams was spending a lot of not nice time speaking on me. I tuned in to her show to catch the last few minutes of her speaking about me and as in the past she seems not to be able to speak without maliciously made comments. My hope is my name will refrain from being spoken or thought of by her as this conversation was held a few years ago letting her know there was nor would be any need for her to say the name Dionne Warwick for any reason. I don’t believe one has to be mean to get noticed."</p><p>These are only a few instances of Wendy Williams's behavior.</p><h2 id=montel-williams-puts-wendy-williams-on-blast>Montel Williams Puts Wendy Williams On Blast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/montel-and-wendy.jpg><p>The Montel Williams Show is known for sharing heartwarming, wholesome content, as opposed to the controversy that follows The Wendy Williams Show.</p><p>This difference makes Montel's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">answer when asked if he has any words of advice </a>for Wendy make sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He said, "Wendy’s show is so much different than mine, where she does a program that literally has for years now, honestly, belittled and put down people who are going through what she’s going through. So it’s that crazy thought that needs to go through your head. Be careful who you point a finger at because you never know when one of them is pointing back."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Says Wendy Williams Should've Been Hospitalized For A Mental Health Check 'Years Ago'</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-wendy-williams-39-s-battle-with-her-health>Inside Wendy Williams's Battle With Her Health</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/st4.depositphotos.com/1694341/31576/i/600/depositphotos_315762914-stock-photo-wendy-williams-star-ceremony.jpg><p>Wendy Williams <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is currently battling Graves Disease,</a> a condition that causes the immune system to attack the thyroid. In 2018 she had to take 3 weeks off work due to health issues. More recently, she has withdrawn from the 2023 Atlanta Women’s Expo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The official statement on her absence said, "We regretfully have to inform you that Wendy Williams would not be appearing at The Ultimate Women’s Expo in Atlanta on May 20th, 2023. It was with great consideration that we felt it was best for Wendy to join the Ultimate Women’s Expo at a later date." It notably did not provide a reason for her absence.</p><p>A source told Page Six that "Wendy’s ability to perform has been rocky at best. She can put together a sentence one day but not the next. There have been serious questions recently about if she will ever get better."</p><p>These claims are validated by her son, who recently did an interview with The US Sun where he shared his fear about his mother's health. He also shared his concern that his mom was being taken advantage of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What's been made more important by the people around her is that while her health may not be great, she needs to keep on earning income, and in my opinion, that should not be a priority at all. And whoever has been hired - they are taking advantage of someone who needs to get better."</p><p>Williams is currently filming an unnamed project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmpZ%2Bjwaa4jLCgpaSZlrq0ecCnm2avlaOxunnWoqOloZGiwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html&text=What%20Happened%20Between%20Montel%20Williams%20And%20Wendy%20Williams%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Montel%20Williams%20And%20Wendy%20Williams%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Montel%20Williams%20And%20Wendy%20Williams%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Montel%20Williams%20And%20Wendy%20Williams%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-montel-williams-and-wendy-williams.html&description=What%20Happened%20Between%20Montel%20Williams%20And%20Wendy%20Williams%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./13-going-on-30-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="13 Going on 30 Cast: Where Are They Now?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./there-s-an-app-to-help-you-choose-the-right-hbcu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="There's An App To Help You Choose The Right HBCU">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
