LeBlanc is widely known for his portrayal of the goofy, lady-chasing Joey Tribbiani on the NBC sitcom, a role <a href=#>the actor snagged after a booze-crazed wild night out</a> when he, allegedly <a href=#>had only $11 dollars left to his name</a>. For his work on the hit TV sitcom— which ran from 1994 to 2004— LeBlanc received three Emmy nominations and became a household name. But the actor's ventures in Hollywood following the end of the show have definitely maintained—if not, added to his staggering net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of 2023, <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc </a></strong>has an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $85 million</a> dollars. He's certainly come a long way from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his early days when he filed his own tooth</a>, because he couldn't afford to visit the dentist. So how has LeBlanc maintained his impressive net worth after all these years? Let's jump into it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc Refused To Answer His Agent Once His Decade Long Run On Friends Came To An End</a></span></p><h2 id=royalties-from-friends-are-very-generous-to-matt-leblanc><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Royalties From Friends Are Very Generous To Matt LeBlanc</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-4.jpg><p>Back when Friends was at its peak on the air, Matt LeBlanc and his costars managed to negotiate incredible deals for themselves. The cast members reportedly banded together, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">successfully negotiated their historic $1 million-per-episode pay deals</a>, demanding they all be paid the same amount or they would leave the show. That was certainly a hefty takeaway for the costars back then, setting LeBlanc up for success early in his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, even since the show was wrapped, the sitcom continues to keep LeBlanc paid. How? The re-runs of the sitcom are a yearly blessing for him. According to a past report by USA Today, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">each Friends actor earns an estimated $19-$20 million a year from royalties off the show</a>. So, every time viewers binge the unforgettable episodes of the NBC sitcom, it's of lucrative gain to LeBlanc and his costars.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-kept-the-momentum-going-after-friends-with-the-spin-off-joey><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matt LeBlanc Kept The Momentum Going After Friends With The Spin-Off, Joey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/joey-tv-show.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After production of Friends wrapped, Matt LeBlanc continued Joey Tribianni's journey on a new show. Fans were recovering tearfully from the end the sitcom, when the announcement of its spin-off Joey gave them hope. The new show was set to follow Joey's ventures in Hollywood as an actor, surrounded by his family members. Matt LeBlanc debuted his new show in the fall of 2004. By the summer of 2006, the <a href=#>show had already come to an end after two seasons and 46 episodes</a>. Even though the show was unsuccessful, it proved that the actor still had the chops to continue a career outside the confine of Friends, setting him up for future endeavors as an actor and even earning him a People's Choice Award.</p><p>LeBlanc opened up about the struggles with the failed sitcom saying, "I would do that again; I thought that it was a good show. I just think that we were telling stories that emasculated the character. They wrote a guy who became very doubtful of himself in this new place, in Hollywood, no friends, can't meet girls - and that's not who Joey was. He was always, always, always, the consummate optimist. Always. And that's not who they wrote. That was very frustrating for me," according to the Guardian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Matthew Perry Vs Matt LeBlanc: Who Has A Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-makes-a-successful-return-from-acting-hiatus-in-episodes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Matt LeBlanc Makes A Successful Return From Acting Hiatus In Episodes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar43713857.jpg><p>The cancelation of Joey may have dealt a harsh blow to Matt LeBlanc as the actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took a six-year hiatus from acting </a>afterword.

His performance on the sitcom, in which he played a satirical version of himself, earned him a Golden Globe Award. Perhaps it was the fact that she show was written by Friends creators David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, but it became the perfect onscreen opportunity to refuel LeBlanc's acting career and a project<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he said he was lucky to be a part of</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I did have a reservation in the beginning. I wasn’t comfortable playing myself,” LeBlanc told Variety. “But they said, ‘Well, we’re not making a documentary. If there’s anything you’re uncomfortable with, we’ll change it. We’ll get through it together.’ And it was because of my history with them that I really felt comfortable. I don’t know that I would have played that part with someone that I had a new relationship with. It was because of the trust that I said OK. I felt safe in their hands.”</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-began-hosting-top-gear><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Matt LeBlanc Began Hosting Top Gear</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2012, Matt LeBlanc appeared in an episode of the British show, Top Gear, where he set the fastest lap time in the “Star in a Reasonably Priced Car” segment in a Kia Ceed.

The actor would go on to continue the venture, signing a two-year deal later that same year. LeBlanc joined journalist Chris Harris and presenter Rory Reid as one of the three frontmen for seasons 24 to 26.
