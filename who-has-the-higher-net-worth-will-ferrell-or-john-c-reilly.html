It’s not easy to find a great duo, which is why the fans cherish the movies that they make together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are a hilarious comedic duo who have made some <a href=#>fantastic comedy films, like Step Brothers for example</a>. Not only are they great co-stars, but they have developed a unique friendship away from the cameras, as well. Both men have been successful in Hollywood, leading some to wonder which guy has the higher net worth at the moment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Getting Fired For Losing $500 As Bank Teller Changed Will Ferrell's Life</a></span></p><p>So, who is boasting the bigger bank account? Let’s take a look at these hilarious actors and see who has pulled ahead.</p><h2 id=ferrell-and-reilly-have-made-bank-together>Ferrell And Reilly Have Made Bank Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ferrell-reilly.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before taking a look at the wealth that each man has amassed individually, we need to have a look at what they have done together. As a comedy duo, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly have been dynamic on the big screen, and thanks to this, they have managed to make a mint while working with one another.</p><p>Back in 2006, the guys starred alongside one another in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The film was a success at the box office, and it showed the world just how hilarious these guys could be working with each other. From there, things would escalate the when the duo made Step Brothers a classic.</p><p>For many, Step Brothers is the best movie that Ferrell and Reilly made together, and it’s easy to see why. The movie is insanely quotable, and <a href=#>it has one memorable scene after the next</a>. Throw in the fact that the cast had performers like Adam Scott and Kathryn Hahn, and you have yourself a recipe for success. The film was released in 2008, and it showed people that the duo were for real.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There have been smaller collaborations that have taken place through the years, including Anchorman 2, but the guys came together for 2018’s Holmes & Watson, which wasn’t quite up to par with what they had done previously. Hopefully, a future collaboration will be closer to their previous works.</p><p>As great as they have been together, we do need to look at them as individuals in terms of their net worth. Unsurprisingly, both men are worth millions.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet John C. Reilly's Wife And Two Sons</a></span></p><h2 id=reilly-is-worth-50-million>Reilly Is Worth $50 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spl5048707_002.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebrityNetWorth</a>, the hilarious John C. Reilly is worth $50 million. His time with Will Ferrell has been great, yes, but looking at his body of work will show that Reilly is a major talent who has been in a number of truly incredible films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reilly began his time in Hollywood back in the 80s, and he has never shied away from trying his hand at different genres. 1990’s Days of Thunder was a big project for the actor, and it really got the ball rolling on what was to come as the years rolled by. In the 90s, Reilly would land movies like What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, The River Wild, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia.</p><p>During the 2000s, Reilly would continue his hot hand with movies like The Perfect Storm, The Good Girl, Gangs of New York, Chicago, Anger Management, The Aviator, and his aforementioned films with Ferrell. Yeah, his list of credits is insane, and this isn’t even including Guardians of the Galaxy or Wreck-It Ralph.</p><p>Reilly has made a fortune, but he doesn’t quite hit the same level that Will Ferrell does in the net worth department.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrell-is-worth-160-million>Ferrell Is Worth $160 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/spl9246761_088.jpg><p>At this time, Will Ferrell is worth an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$160 million</a>, which places him comfortably ahead of Reilly. It is a staggering amount of money, and it has come after years of incredible success for Ferrell.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Ferrell And Ryan Reynolds Hilariously Swapped Late Night Talks Shows Without Telling Jimmy Kimmel Or Jimmy Fallon</a></span>Ferrell’s big break came in the 90s when he was cast on Saturday Night Live. He would spend years becoming a household name on the show, taking part in movies like Austin Powers, A Night at the Roxbury, and Zoolander while still on the show. After leaving SNL, however, Ferrell turned into a mega star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of his most notable credits include Elf, Anchorman, Old School, Blades of Glory, Megamind, and The Lego Movie. On top of that, Ferrell has been heavily involved in producing movies, which has no doubt been profitable for the star. All of this success has had a hand in his net worth reaching such great heights.</p><p>In the battle of <a href=#>massive net worths, it’s Ferrell who comes out on top</a> here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60edOhnGagmZy1pr6Mp5ytZaekv7W0jLCgpaRdm7KzvsSlo2anomK3sLTNZppmqpWeua3Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html&text=Who%20Has%20The%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Will%20Ferrell%20Or%20John%20C.%20Reilly%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html&title=Who%20Has%20The%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Will%20Ferrell%20Or%20John%20C.%20Reilly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html&title=Who%20Has%20The%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Will%20Ferrell%20Or%20John%20C.%20Reilly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html&title=Who%20Has%20The%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Will%20Ferrell%20Or%20John%20C.%20Reilly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-has-the-higher-net-worth-will-ferrell-or-john-c-reilly.html&description=Who%20Has%20The%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Will%20Ferrell%20Or%20John%20C.%20Reilly%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-zolciak-sells-off-designer-wear-amid-massive-debt-with-kroy-bierm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Kim Zolciak Sells Off Designer Wear Amid Massive Debt With Kroy Bierm">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-kind-of-challenge-does-survivor-need-to-bring-back.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What kind of challenge does Survivor need to bring back?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
