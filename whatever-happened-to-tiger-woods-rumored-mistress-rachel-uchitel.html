Rachel Uchitel, the woman Tiger Woods had an extramarital affair with that came to light in 2009, rose to fame after being romantically involved with the athlete.However, she was silenced after signing an $8 million non-disclosure agreement.More than a decade after their affair came to an end, Rachel is reportedly working on a tell-all memoir – where she reveals intimate details of her relationship with the sports star, despite promising her silence.Aside from opening her side of the story, many are also wondering about her whereabouts and what happened to her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-rachel-uchitel>What Happened To Rachel Uchitel?</h2><p>According to Page Six, Rachel is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gearing up to release an explosive new book</a> with agent David Vigliano – who has previously worked with a list of famous names like Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.</p><p>The outlet reported that the book will document the former mistress’ whole life story, including her high-profile affair with Tiger Woods.</p><p>It can be remembered that a story was published in November 2009 claiming that the golfer had had an extramarital affair with Rachel, who was a New York City nightclub manager at the time and who denied the relationship.</p><p>Now, people may finally hear her side of the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-has-been-sharing-details-about-her-time-with-tiger>Rachel Has Been Sharing Details About Her Time With Tiger</h2><p>The source claimed, “Everyone thinks they know her story, but they really don’t.” Before rising to fame and being known as Tiger Woods’ mistress, Rachel worked as a correspondent for Extra, opened a toy store, and became <a href=#>a spokesperson for sugar daddy site Seeking Arrangements.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Not Even Tiger Woods’ Close Friends New About His Secret Life</a></span></p><p>Aside from her upcoming book, Rachel was able to share <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truths about what really happened between her and the golfer</a>.</p><p>She explained in the interview how she met Woods saying, “I was running one of the clubs in NYC. I probably hosted every famous athlete or celebrity you can think of. They come for the best night of their lives. And I’m the person who is going to facilitate that for them. This is how I met Tiger Woods.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Tiger Woods Save His Girlfriend From Her Insane Financial Troubles?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then revealed, “I knew he was married. I knew he had responsibilities. But he said, ‘I want you to fly to Orlando and then I will come see you there'.”</p><p>At that time, Woods was married to Elin. Unfortunately, their secret was revealed and that’s when Rachel knew “the end” of her life as she knew it.</p><p>“People came at me like they wanted to blame me for the fact that a married man cheated on his wife, It was like I was the only one responsible for Tiger’s actions,” she shared.</p><p>It was then that she had to sign a settlement of confidentiality, which meant no tell-all interviews.</p><h2 id=uchitel-s-experiences-are-colored-by-her-past>Uchitel's Experiences Are Colored By Her Past</h2><p>Somewhat unable to escape the shadow of her link to Tiger Woods, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel found it hard to move forward in other areas of her life</a>, from launching a business to finding a lifetime partner.</p><p>She had attempted to open two children’s clothing ventures in New York in 2013 and 2015.

Due to her tarnished reputation, she wasn’t able to progress in life – leading her to file for bankruptcy.</p><p>With bills piling up and her name “getting dragged through the mud,” she has nothing but her own side of the story to tell.</p><p>While she has to deal with the aftermath of her affair, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel tied the knot with former Penn State footballer Matt Hahn</a>. The couple welcomed a daughter before they separated ways in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then she made headlines again after news broke out that she allegedly had an affair with a San Diego lawyer named Ed Batts, who reportedly left his wife and three kids.</p><p>It is unclear whether Rachel and Ed are still together, and hopefully, she would reveal some juicy tidbits of her affairs as well. In fact, there’s probably going to be a bombshell in her book, especially the dishing on her romance with Tiger Woods.</p><p>Even though more than a decade has gone by, the downfall and failures of the golfer are still a hot topic that certainly fascinates the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam2qLHRZq6op5SoerPBzKipnpxdora0wNGeqqxlopawqbHLZqycoJmpsq17</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html&text=Whatever%20Happened%20To%20Tiger%20Woods%27%20Rumored%20Mistress%2c%20Rachel%20Uchitel%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html&title=Whatever%20Happened%20To%20Tiger%20Woods%27%20Rumored%20Mistress%2c%20Rachel%20Uchitel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html&title=Whatever%20Happened%20To%20Tiger%20Woods%27%20Rumored%20Mistress%2c%20Rachel%20Uchitel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html&title=Whatever%20Happened%20To%20Tiger%20Woods%27%20Rumored%20Mistress%2c%20Rachel%20Uchitel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhatever-happened-to-tiger-woods-rumored-mistress-rachel-uchitel.html&description=Whatever%20Happened%20To%20Tiger%20Woods%27%20Rumored%20Mistress%2c%20Rachel%20Uchitel%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./halloween-search-terms-and-top-paying-affiliate-programs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Halloween Search Terms and Top Paying Affiliate Programs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tlc-s-chilli-usher-never-cheated-on-her-was-her-first-real-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TLC's Chilli: Usher Never Cheated on Her, Was Her First &amp;quot;Real Love&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
