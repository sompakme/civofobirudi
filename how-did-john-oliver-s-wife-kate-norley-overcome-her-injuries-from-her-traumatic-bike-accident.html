Norley might have only had one small movie role in the entirety of her film career, but that does not cancel out that she is in fact, a badass in real life. An Iraq War veteran, Kate joined the army and served as a United States Army medic after witnessing the horrors of the tragic 9/11 attacks. She started her training in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina before enrolling for medical training in Ft. Sam Houston, Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Matt Damon Helped His BFF Ben Affleck Overcome His Addiction</a></span></p><p>During her time in the Army, Kate worked as a mental health specialist, providing counseling to soldiers who suffered from PTSD. This is no coincidence seeing as Norley has had her own share of <a href=#>traumatic experiences</a>. When she was only 16, Kate was involved in an accident when a reckless car driver collided with her bike. The teenager suffered severe head trauma that could have meant the end for anyone else. But Norley, even as a teen, was tougher than most her age. She overcame her injuries and came out even stronger. How did she do this? Take a look.</p><h2 id=she-had-to-re-learn-how-to-read-and-write><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Had To Re-Learn How To Read And Write</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate’s injuries damaged her cognitive skills, meaning that after the accident, she could no longer read or write. But rather than give up, the teenager only pressed forward and took up the challenge of re-learning basic reading and writing skills. Having to re-learn how to read and write as a 16-year-old teenager would have been a Herculean task for any teenager, but <a href=#>Norley</a> isn't your average girl, and she's proved that over and over again in the years that have passed since the accident.</p><h2 id=kate-had-support-from-her-mom><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kate Had Support From Her Mom</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A mother's love and support during difficult times cannot be undermined and Kate is one to attest to this. Following the accident, Kate’s mom, Pam Minnion took up the role of a supportive parent by helping the teenager navigate her pain and helping her get back on her feet. Norley has since admitted that her mother’s relentless encouragement and support serves as an inspiration even today. Despite the pain of her parents divorcing from a young age, Norley has always had her mother to lean on and what greater joy than the assurance of a great support system!</p><h2 id=norley-kept-at-her-dreams><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Norley Kept At Her Dreams</span></h2><p>Kate has always been passionate about <a href=#>empowering women</a>, hence her one dream is to start a women-led non-profit organization with no ties to religion or politics. Through this, she hopes to make a difference by empowering women in different forms. One way Norley hopes to achieve this is by sending American women to developing countries to show women there what it feels like to have certain rights and exercise them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Riverdale' Star Camila Mendes Opens Up About Overcoming An Eating Disorder</a></span></p><h2 id=she-started-advocating-for-war-veterans><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Started Advocating For War Veterans</span></h2><p>Upon her return to the United States, Norley started <a href=#>advocating </a>for war veterans, something which her husband has found to be quite inspiring. “When you’ve married someone who’s been at war, there is nothing you can do that compares to that level of selflessness and bravery,” Oliver said during <a href=#>a 2013 interview with Esquire</a>.</p><h2 id=she-started-volunteering><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Started Volunteering</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years after her traumatic accident, Norley joined Team Rubicon, a nonprofit organization that works to send veterans and qualified civilians with first responder skills to disaster sites and risk areas to perform relief efforts, give medical care, and infrastructure repair.</p><p>Kate was also actively involved in the 2014 New York City Half Marathon, which was aimed at helping low-income homeowners. Aside from successfully raising more than $1,000 and competing in the marathon, Norley also participated in volunteer opportunities with Rebuilding Together as part of their Race2Rebuild initiative with the NYC Marathon and Half-Marathon. Given her background, it's not surprising that Norley would take to the non-profit cause and work with them to help other victims of accidents and disasters. Somehow, she has been able to use her traumatic experience to motivate her efforts and dedication to service.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Madonna Reveals She Has Overcome Physical Setbacks And Is Ready For Her Comeback</a></span></p><h2 id=she-helps-children><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Helps Children</span></h2><p>Apart from helping war veterans and older people, Norley is also dedicated to <a href=#>helping children</a>. During her time in the army, Kate spent a large amount of time tending to Iraqi children and showing them love in the best way she could. Spending time with these kids proved therapeutic for Norley and ultimately helped her overcome the trauma from her accident.</p><h2 id=her-husband-rsquo-s-support-has-also-helped><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Her Husband’s Support Has Also Helped</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from having a helpful mother who helped her regain her impaired cognitive abilities, and apart from being a formidable woman herself, Kate Norley has a husband who adores and supports her. The television host, John Oliver, can't help but express how his wife inspires him with her philanthropy and tenacity. Although they have different political ideologies, they've both put their differences aside. Additionally, he loves her life experiences, particularly her bravery and service to her country. He described life with her as emasculating, an interesting thing to say from someone who has won several Emmys.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s How Dating Megan Fox Helped Machine Gun Kelly Overcome His Addiction Issues</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecmon6dln6G2t7HRZq6inpViuKLAxGalqKqcmsZuu9WeqZynnZp6qrrJrqminaNis7O7zGarq5mloq61tcJmmaKjlWKupK%2FInZynrF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html&text=How%20Did%20John%20Oliver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Kate%20Norley%2c%20Overcome%20Her%20Injuries%20From%20Her%20Traumatic%20Bike%20Accident&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html&title=How%20Did%20John%20Oliver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Kate%20Norley%2c%20Overcome%20Her%20Injuries%20From%20Her%20Traumatic%20Bike%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html&title=How%20Did%20John%20Oliver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Kate%20Norley%2c%20Overcome%20Her%20Injuries%20From%20Her%20Traumatic%20Bike%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html&title=How%20Did%20John%20Oliver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Kate%20Norley%2c%20Overcome%20Her%20Injuries%20From%20Her%20Traumatic%20Bike%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-john-oliver-s-wife-kate-norley-overcome-her-injuries-from-her-traumatic-bike-accident.html&description=How%20Did%20John%20Oliver%27s%20Wife%2c%20Kate%20Norley%2c%20Overcome%20Her%20Injuries%20From%20Her%20Traumatic%20Bike%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-tuesday-morning-going-out-of-business.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Tuesday Morning Going Out of Business?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./father-raps-to-his-daughter-for-woman-crush-wednesday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Father Raps To His Daughter For 'Woman Crush Wednesday'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
