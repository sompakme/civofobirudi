However, her sister Nicky Hilton's marriage is just as fascinating. Nicky Hilton's husband James Rothschild is a member of a famously wealthy family (and wealthy would be an understatement). Thanks to the Rothschild family net worth, all eyes were on Nicky Hilton's wedding back in 2015. In the years since, the couple has continued to live incredibly well. From <a href=#>Nicky Hilton and James Rothschild's pandemic lifestyle</a> to <a href=#>whether Nicky Hilton signed a prenup</a>, there are a lot of questions about the pair.</p><p>Considering the wealth of the Hilton family, it was clear that when Paris and Nicky Hilton got married, they would spend a lot of money on the ceremony and reception.

According to Celebrity Net Worth, the <strong>Rothschilds have a net worth of $400 billion</strong>. That number would be more than enough to pay for a fancy and over-the-top wedding.

While they did pay a lot for their big day, it might be surprising to hear that they didn't spend even more. <a href=#>Nicky Hilton herself has a lot of money</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Nicky Hilton's net worth is $100 million</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2015, The Standard published an article called "Nicky Hilton and James Rothschild's trillion dollar wedding at Kensington Palace," which suggests that this is how much the couple spent on their wedding.</p><p>While the couple hasn't confirmed the amount that they spent, it's clear that they didn't spare any expense. For one thing, as The Daily Mail reported, Nicky Hilton wore a dress by Valentino that she spent £50,000 on. Since Nicky Hilton herself has a net worth of $100 million, as reported by Celebrity Net Worth, she could have picked any dress that she wanted. As it turns out, as WWD.com reported, Valentino designed a dress especially for Nicky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>James Rothschild And Nicky Hilton's Relationship Milestones</p></th><th scope=col><p>Key Dates (According to Us Weekly)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>began their relationship</p></td><td><p>2011</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>got engaged in Lake Como</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>got married</p></td><td><p>2015</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>welcomed daughters Lily-Grace and Teddy</p></td><td><p>2016 and 2017</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>announced pregnancy with third baby</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In an interview with W Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicky Hilton talked about her wedding dress</a> and shared more about the process of working with the famous and beloved designer.
