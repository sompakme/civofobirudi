Tom Cruise had no intention of letting the film go straight to streaming, and he opened up about why that was not too long ago. We have all those details below!</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-is-a-legend>Tom Cruise Is A Legend</h2><p>When it comes to making hit movies for the big screen, few stars in cinema history have been as successful as Tom Cruise. He had a relatively modest start in the movie business, but once Cruise was given the opportunity to shine, he became one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Risky Business was the film that really helped put Tom Cruise on the map, and this was all the way back in 1983. The actor would then dominate the rest of the decade with movies like Top Gun, The Color of Money, Rain Man, and Born on the Fourth of July.</p><p>The 1990s were just as kind to the actor, as he kicked things off with Days of Thunder, and starred in huge movies like Interview with the Vampire, Mission: Impossible, Jerry Maguire, and the more.</p><p>Still not impressed? Cruise has continued starring in colossal hits since the turn of the millennium, and at this point, he has nothing left to accomplish, save for an Oscar win.</p><p>Cruise is still starring in great movies, and his latest release is a film that has been over 35 years in the making.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Women Tom Cruise Has Dated And Their Massive Net Worths</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-starring-in-39-top-gun-maverick-39>He's Starring In 'Top Gun: Maverick'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This month, Top Gun: Maverick is finally hitting theaters after a series of delays. The film, which is a sequel to the 1986 classic, looks amazing, and Tom Cruise seems like he never left the role at all.</p><p>"Maverick follows Cruise’s hotshot fighter pilot several decades after the original 1986 film left off. The Joseph Kosinski-directed blockbuster sees Maverick called back to the Top Gun flight academy to train a new group of pilots — most notably the son of his former flight partner Goose: Rooster, played by Teller — for a dangerous mission that involves an underground stash of uranium that is a threat to global security," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> writes.</p><p>So far, the movie is getting incredible reviews by those that have had a chance to see it. It is receiving high praise for a number of different aspects, and the stunt work that is briefly shown in the previews certainly indicates that this movie is ramping things up from what fans saw in the original back in the 1980s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a while, people weren't sure whether this movie was actually going to hit the big screen or not. Come to find out, Tom Cruise had no intention of this movie being seen at home.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Forgotten Facts About Tom Cruise And Penelope Cruz's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-cruise-only-makes-films-for-the-big-screen>Tom Cruise Only Makes Films For The Big-Screen</h2><p>Over the last couple of years, it has become increasingly more common to see movies hit streaming services straight out the gate instead of hitting the big screen. This was a route that Paramount could have taken with Top Gun: Maverick, but Tom Cruise made sure that this was never going to come into play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Cruise</a>, who spoke at Cannes, "That’s not going to happen. Ever. I’ve spent a lot of time with theater owners. The people that serve the popcorn, the ones who make this [happen]."</p><p>Cruise also let movie theater owners know, "Please, I know what you’re going through. Just know we are making ‘Mission: Impossible’ and ‘Top Gun’ is coming out.”</p><p>These are strong words, and clearly, the actor has no interest in his movies going straight to streaming.</p><p>He punctuated his speech with, "I make movies for the big screen."</p><p>Slowly but surely, more and more movies are seeing bigger returns at the box office, and this is definitely good news for upcoming releases. The straight-to-streaming model definitely worked for some movies, but others are clearly meant to be seen on the big screen, and this is precisely why Cruise make sure that Top Gun: Maverick was heading to theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Maher Completely Ripped John Cena And Tom Cruise On 'Real-Time', Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Given the rave reviews that the film is getting, Top Gun: Maverick is worth the price of admission and popcorn to experience on the big screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Tom Cruise's Relationship With His Father Completely Fell Apart When He Was Young</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqbyuecKrrKKrlWK%2FprLUrJydZaSkeq2x02arqKhdnMKvecyarZ6qmZi4brPOZqqtqpGetKnAjK2mZqukp7Kiucinnmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html&text=Maverick%27%20Go%20Straight%20To%20Streaming&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html&title=Maverick%27%20Go%20Straight%20To%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html&title=Maverick%27%20Go%20Straight%20To%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html&title=Maverick%27%20Go%20Straight%20To%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaverick-go-straight-to-streaming.html&description=Maverick%27%20Go%20Straight%20To%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-simone-ledward-net-worth-nationality-age-wiki-biography-sister-mother-wedding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Simone Ledward Net Worth: Nationality, Age, Wiki, Biography, Sister, Mother, Wedding">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./linda-blair-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Linda Blair Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
