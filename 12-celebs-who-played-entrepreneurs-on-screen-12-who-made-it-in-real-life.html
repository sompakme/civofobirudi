Which is a sentiment that many celebrities out there can definitely say they have had some first-hand experience with. Like George Clooney who had the money handy to test out countless versions of Tequila before finding the perfect mix that doesn't leave you feeling like a zombie the next day. The result was the company,&nbsp;Casamigos Tequila, that was later sold&nbsp;in a deal that could be worth upwards of $1 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many prominent female celebrities have also used their good looks and fame to get into the world of fashion. The results&nbsp;are in some cases, extraordinary, such as Jessica Simpson whose company has earned over $1 billion in revenue. Kylie Jenner may also have her fair share of haters, but after you hear how well her cosmetics line is doing, you may find it hard to not be impressed.</p><p>Several actors have also used their talent to portray the lives of, in some cases, some of the most influential entrepreneurs of all-time. The results of which has at times led to movies that have made hundreds of millions at the box office. As well as some performances being nominated for Academy Awards, like Meryl Streep who helped bring Julia Child back to life. The success of the films also means that it was definitely a good idea to have created that movie! And as for the ones that didn't make their budget back, like&nbsp;The Founder, at least they tried.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are&nbsp;13 Celebs Who Played Entrepreneurs On Screen (12 Who Made It In Real Life)</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-the-wolf-of-wallstreet><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf Of Wallstreet)</strong></h2><p>Leonardo DiCaprio definitely brought a high level of energy to his performance of the businessman (and criminal) Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wallstreet. While the corruption that Belfort engages in is not recommended to be followed by other entrepreneurs, his performance is truly something special. The movie ended up earning over $350 million at the box office and had a critical consensus of 78% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film is also commended for the fantastic performance that is delivered by Margot Robbie.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=dr-dre-beats-by-dr-dre><strong>Dr. Dre (Beats By Dr. Dre)</strong></h2><p>I'm not too sure what type of headphones you like to use, or if that is even something that you are concerned about. But there are many people out there who think that Beats by Dr. Dre are not worth the money that some of them can cost. But that's not a concern of Dr. Dre who after helping start up the company in 2006, ended up selling the brand to Apple in 2014 to the value of $3 billion!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=will-smith-the-pursuit-of-happyness><strong>Will Smith (The Pursuit Of Happyness)</strong></h2><p>Will Smith has been fortunate enough that he has never had to face the task of being a father while also being homeless. But that was the task set in front of Chris Gardner whose perseverance led to him stating the stock brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Co.

And while I do commend Ashton Kutcher for being willing to take on the risk of that role, sadly, there are many negative qualities about the movie Jobs. Which is probably why critics ended up giving the movie a score of 28% on Rotten Tomatoes. Though if you want to see Kutcher play a role very different from something like Michael Kelso on That '70s Show, you may still enjoy this film.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><h2 id=george-clooney-casamigos-tequila><strong>George Clooney (Casamigos Tequila)</strong></h2><p>George Clooney and Rande Gerber were enjoying some time in Mexico when they decided to come up with an idea to create their own type of Tequila,</p><p>"We wanted one that didn't burn going down, that was super smooth...One that we didn't have to mix — typically we drink it straight or on the rocks – that we could drink all day long and not be hungover in the morning," said Gerber.

But it's possible Jenner may not mind when she gains any level of publicity as any publicity is good publicity for her brands. Which means that she's also smart enough to often be seen leaving the house wearing some cosmetics from her own brand which Forbes estimated at being worth $800 million.

It was about doing something that empowers other women, something that's going to break down barriers," said Khloe when talking about why she founded the company.

But Seth Rogen completely disappeared into the role of Steve Wozniak for the 2015 film Steve Jobs, though it's possible you enjoyed Michael Fassbender's performance of Steve Jobs even more! Either way, the score of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes should make you feel confident it won't be a waste of your time.</p><p>(Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWd6pLHLnpmsZaedvG68y5qwnpxdmru1vsSpqZ6mlaq%2FtHnOp2Ssm6Kasq95kGtksKCfYrqisMRmoK1lmaN6s7HApWSloZaafA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html&text=12%20Celebs%20Who%20Played%20Entrepreneurs%20On%20Screen%20%2812%20Who%20Made%20It%20In%20Real%20Life%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Who%20Played%20Entrepreneurs%20On%20Screen%20%2812%20Who%20Made%20It%20In%20Real%20Life%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Who%20Played%20Entrepreneurs%20On%20Screen%20%2812%20Who%20Made%20It%20In%20Real%20Life%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html&title=12%20Celebs%20Who%20Played%20Entrepreneurs%20On%20Screen%20%2812%20Who%20Made%20It%20In%20Real%20Life%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f12-celebs-who-played-entrepreneurs-on-screen-12-who-made-it-in-real-life.html&description=12%20Celebs%20Who%20Played%20Entrepreneurs%20On%20Screen%20%2812%20Who%20Made%20It%20In%20Real%20Life%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-look-at-mary-kate-olsen-and-olivier-sarkozy-s-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look At Mary-Kate Olsen And Olivier Sarkozys Relationship Timeline">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-mikko-rantanen-parents-colorado-avalanche-nhl-player-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Mikko Rantanen Parents?
