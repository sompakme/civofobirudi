Underwood made headlines for all the wrong reasons but has since recovered from all the backlash. After almost a decade, we are diving back into what happened all those years ago. There would be no celebrity Matthew Underwood without the comedy-drama, Zoey 101 so let's start from there. This show put Underwood on the map and ran for a total of four seasons from 2005-2008.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Seasons Of Zoey 101 Were Jamie Lynn Spears And Alexa Nikolas Feuding For?</a></span></p><p>Fans can still feel the stinging pain as they watched Chase's "I Love You," text cause Zoey's phone to vibrate right into the fountain. To this day, the show is one of the most successful Nickelodeon series. Many stars including Jamie Lynn Spears, Victoria Justice, Christopher Massey, Alexa Nikolas, Paul Butcher, Erin Sanders, and Sean Flynn got their start there. A bunch of these child stars continued acting while others left the entertainment industry for good.

In particular, Matthew Underwood's life post-show wasn't pretty for a while. He found himself in some legal troubles after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being caught in possession of weed</a> in Port St. Lucie, Florida. On top of that, Underwood was accompanied by a minor and was found in a bedroom with the 17-year-old girl. This all went down back in April of 2012 but didn't end there. Underwood was arrested and put on probation for his illegal actions.</p><h2 id=why-was-matthew-underwood-arrested><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Was Matthew Underwood Arrested?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49192368.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor then decided to make an appearance at the hookah bar he co-owned which violated his 12-month probation. That night in 2012, Underwood was intercepted by police around 3 A.M. at his hookah lounge in St. Lucie called Cloud 9. The actor found himself behind bars for the second time that year.</p><p>Luckily for the 22-year-old, the judges decided he would stay out of prison even though his probation officer urged them to consider sending him to jail for 180 days. Matthew proved to be compliant for the majority of his probation and therefore finished out the rest of his probation smoothly.</p><h2 id=matthew-underwood-39-s-redemption><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Matthew Underwood's Redemption</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49024094.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After laying low and working on himself the actor made headlines five years later. Back in 2017, Matt rescued a baby that was found in a crashed car along with two adults who allegedly overdosed on heroin. The heroic act saved this child's life after a judge ruled that the four-month-old be given to a family member.</p><p>"He happened to be one of the first people on the scene where the female driver was passed out at the wheel with a syringe of heroin in her arm. The babyâ€™s father was sleeping in the back seat next to an unsecured car seat. So <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew reportedly took the uninjured baby out of the car </a>and had his brother call 911. He also took video before he intervened just in case."</p><p>The act of heroism essentially erased everyone's negative views of the actor. Since then, Underwood has been back in everyone's good graces, but he had already made a slight change in career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest Reveals 'Zoey 101' Star Alexa Nikolas Is Making On Instagram</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-matthew-underwood-doing-now><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is Matthew Underwood Doing Now?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49204289.jpg><p>Matt Underwood has taken a turn in his career from in front to behind the camera. After his arrest scandal and being in the limelight at such a young age, Underwood is enjoying his time out of the spotlight. He still gets to be involved in the entertainment industry, but now instead of just acting, he's taking on the whole concept of storytelling.</p><p>Underwood has directed a bunch of shorts films like The Unicorn Sisters, The Alien, and The Golden Stars. His co-star and friend from Zoey 101, Sean Flynn, has even appeared in some of Underwood's projects.

These include but are not limited to Sex And The City, Gossip Girl, and How I Met Your... Father. It seems as though this reboot idea has been scratched due to the media scrutiny lead Jamie Lynn Spears is under.</p><p><a href=#>Jamie and Zoey 101 co-star Alexa Nikolas were in a feud</a> while filming the show, and Nikolas went public with their fights. Nikolas shared the pattern of bullying that Jamie created on set in the early 2000s, and many fans spoke out their support for the actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie is also under scrutiny due to the fact that her sister, well-known pop sensation Britney Spears, was in a conservatorship legal battle with their father and fans speculate her younger sister has not been much help over the past 13 years. <a href=#>Her co-star Paul Butcher</a>, who played Jamie's little brother on the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took the time to shade the actress on TikTok</a>. Butcher blamed the cancellation of the reboot on Britney Spears's legal battles and the way in which the Spears family were handling the scandal.</p><p>Although a reboot was in the works, it appears that the entire plan was axed. After giving the project a break, producers decided to give it one more try.</p><p>Zoey 102 is currently in post-production and will show the entire cast returning to reprise their roles from the original show. The event will be a movie and will premiere on Paramount+ in the summer of 2023. Jamie Spears announced the exciting news on May 18th, 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidrqScYsC1u9GyZLCgqWK6osDToZywZaWjsaa%2B1qimnWWqpLK6eZBpaGaZoqeytMDEnWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html&text=The%20Full%20Story%20Of%20Why%20Matthew%20Underwood%20From%20%27Zoey%20101%27%20Was%20Arrested&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html&title=The%20Full%20Story%20Of%20Why%20Matthew%20Underwood%20From%20%27Zoey%20101%27%20Was%20Arrested" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html&title=The%20Full%20Story%20Of%20Why%20Matthew%20Underwood%20From%20%27Zoey%20101%27%20Was%20Arrested" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html&title=The%20Full%20Story%20Of%20Why%20Matthew%20Underwood%20From%20%27Zoey%20101%27%20Was%20Arrested" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-full-story-of-why-matthew-underwood-from-zoey-101-was-arrested.html&description=The%20Full%20Story%20Of%20Why%20Matthew%20Underwood%20From%20%27Zoey%20101%27%20Was%20Arrested" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-latest-on-aj-lee-s-wwe-return-former-tna-star-says-he-should-have-sued-the-company-rollins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Latest on AJ Lees WWE Return, Former TNA Star Says He Should Have Sued the Company, Rollins &amp;amp;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sharon-osbourne-s-house-catches-fire-from-candle-ozzy-osbourne-burns-his-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sharon Osbourne's House Catches Fire From Candle, Ozzy Osbourne Burns His Hair">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
