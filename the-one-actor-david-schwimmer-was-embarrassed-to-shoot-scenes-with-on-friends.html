"He had brought an original hangdog expression to his character and was just damn funny. He was also the first one of us to shoot a commercial, be on 'The Tonight Show,' buy a house, get his own movie. He was the hot guy that first year, and rightly so.

Well, David Schwimmer didn't forget the moment given that he was completely embarrassed by what had taken place.
