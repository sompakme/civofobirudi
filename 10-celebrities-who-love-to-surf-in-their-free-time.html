Many residents here take up surfing as a hobby, and those in the entertainment industry are no different. There are tons of actors and actresses who love to ride the waves when they have a spare moment or use it to blow off steam.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrity Insecurities That Remind Us They’re Human, Too</a></span></p><p>We have uncovered some celebrities who love to surf when they have some time off. It acts as a great way for them to stay in shape and spend time with family and friends. Keep reading to learn about 10 celebrities who love to surf in their free time!</p><h2 id=the-hemsworth-brothers>The Hemsworth Brothers</h2><p><a href=#>The Hemsworth brothers are</a> originally from Australia, and they have been surfing since they were kids. They both learned from their father who still surfs with them to this day and the two brothers have often been seen bonding on the waves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is one of their childhood hobbies we doubt they will ever give up as it is one of the many passions that they share as a family. We don't doubt that soon we will see some of Chris's kids out on the water with them as they learn the family trade.</p><h2 id=adam-sandler>Adam Sandler</h2><p>Sandler doesn't surf as much anymore, but in his younger years, he used to go out and enjoy the waves all the time. He told Conan on his talk show once that he was never very good at it, but it never stopped him from trying time and time again.</p><p>Sandler tends to wipe out quite a bit and doesn't understand proper etiquette on the waves, and yet he still loves to go out and try his hand at this sport. We applaud him for his dedication and hope he can improve upon his past mistakes.</p><h2 id=paris-hilton>Paris Hilton</h2><p>Paris Hilton first tried learning how to surf back in 2007, and it appears she has kept up with it over the years. There was a scandal when her first lesson took place as she did undergo a wardrobe malfunction, but it is expected when you decide to wear an outfit such as this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She obviously has a blast, despite her falls and lack of balance, but we bet she has improved as the years have passed. Hilton probably won't win any competitions, although, all that matters is that it is something she enjoys doing.</p><h2 id=andrew-garfield>Andrew Garfield</h2><p>Andrew Garfield has a passion for surfing and has tried to help others throughout the years learn to love it as much as he does. He helped Emma Stone learn the ropes, but Garfield is the one with the skill and talent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrity-Owned Bars, Ranked From Least To Most Expensive</a></span></p><p>Garfield has a kind heart as he has assisted an Autism charity in the past that helped these special needs kids learn to surf with the professionals. We love how he is taking this sport to the next level by assisting those in need who want to have as much fun on the water as he has.</p><h2 id=gisele-b-ndchen>Gisele Bündchen</h2><p>Gisele Bündchen is the wife of Tom Brady, but she is also a supermodel. She and her husband love to vacation down in Costa Rica, where they surf during their vacation. Gisele has even stated how she uses a combination of surfing and yoga to stay in shape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She says that she loves connecting with nature and that she tends to complete her surf sessions with sun salutations. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This is one celebrity we didn't expect to see</a> on this list, but she is one of the biggest supporters of this sport.</p><h2 id=hilary-duff>Hilary Duff</h2><p>Hilary Duff isn't one who spends every waking second trying to catch a wave, but she does enjoy the sport while on vacation. She is often spotted with her son who loves to try surfing right beside her.</p><p>This actress will need a few more lessons before she is able to hit some bigger waves, but for now, she is having a blast learning the basics of this activity. We don't doubt that her son loves it as much as her and we even expect he might continue with it as he grows older.</p><h2 id=jaden-smith>Jaden Smith</h2><p>Jaden Smith loves to surf during his free time, and even recently took to the waves on his 21st birthday. He understands the intricacy involved in navigating a board around the water as he avoids wiping out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Simple Romance: 10 Celebrities Who Had Small, Private Weddings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith always looks great while doing it and it even looks natural to him as he manages to stay standing no matter what hits him. Many never master the art of this sport, but Jaden has a natural talent that can't be overlooked as he rides several waves during his free time.</p><h2 id=matthew-mcconaughey>Matthew McConaughey</h2><p>McConaughey loves to surf in his free time and even starred in a movie about surfing called Surfer, Dude. He had to learn how to surf for the movie, so he spent a lot of time taking lessons in Australia for the film&nbsp;back in 2007.</p><p>He learned of his new passion for the sport after the film was over and he continued to work on it as he goes out during his free time. The outdoors is where he loves to be and this hobby grants him that option as he rides waves in Malibu.</p><h2 id=mario-lopez>Mario Lopez</h2><p>Mario Lopez was first spotted surfing prior <a href=#>to his wedding</a>, but he has more recently been seen on the waves with his entire family. He loves the sport and tries to go out when he can, but after a rotator cuff injury, it made this a little harder to do. Lopez's children are all very active and love the outdoors, so we wouldn't be surprised if he taught them to surf when they become old enough to learn how.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon>Reese Witherspoon</h2><p>Reese Witherspoon loves to go surfing with her boys, even if she doesn't have the time to go all that often. It is awesome how she is able to share this hobby with her boys as they learn to love the waves as much as she does.</p><p>This actress might not be the best on a surfboard, but she does understand how to bond with her children by doing things they love to do. This is one family tradition we doubt will end as her sons seem to enjoy the lessons as much as she does.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrity Divorces In 2019 No One Saw Coming</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nk5q5pq7RoquinaNiwLa%2BxWaqrqqWnruoecWrnJ5lpJ66pnnHqJmboZWofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html&text=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Love%20To%20Surf%20In%20Their%20Free%20Time&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Love%20To%20Surf%20In%20Their%20Free%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Love%20To%20Surf%20In%20Their%20Free%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html&title=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Love%20To%20Surf%20In%20Their%20Free%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-who-love-to-surf-in-their-free-time.html&description=10%20Celebrities%20Who%20Love%20To%20Surf%20In%20Their%20Free%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./all-the-special-appearances-on-modern-family-ranked-by-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All The Special Appearances On 'Modern Family', Ranked By Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kim-zolciak-sells-off-designer-wear-amid-massive-debt-with-kroy-bierm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Kim Zolciak Sells Off Designer Wear Amid Massive Debt With Kroy Bierm">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
