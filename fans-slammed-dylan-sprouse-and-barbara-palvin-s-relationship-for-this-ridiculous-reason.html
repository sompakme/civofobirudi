However, the majority of the photos of Sprouse and Palvin show exactly what everyone is talking about. In fact, there are some photos in which <strong>the couple's resemblance to each other is uncanny</strong>.</p><p>How big of an age difference is there between Barbara Palvin and Dylan Sprouse, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When was Dylan Sprouse born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>August 4, 1992</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Dylan Sprouse born?:</p></td><td><p>Arezzo, Italy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When was Barbara Palvin born</a>?:</p></td><td><p>October 8, 1993</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Where was Barbara Palvin born?:</p></td><td><p>Budapest, Hungary</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Dylan Sprouse than Barbara Palvin?:</p></td><td><p>1 year, 2 months, and 4 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first glance, it seems like there is a cottage industry on the internet of people calling out the couple's physical similarities.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jpg-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does Cole Sprouse's Mom Melanie Wright Ever See Him Or His Twin Brother Dylan Or Are They Completely Estranged As Adults?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cole Sprouse has been surprisingly open about the difficult history he has with his mom Melanie Wright.</span><p>If fans look up the words<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> "Barbara Palvin Dylan Sprouse Look Alike" on TikTok</a>, <strong>a slew of videos will pop up</strong>. In many cases, the videos that pop up will have people in them using the latest social media trends to draw attention to the couple's similar looks.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it is important to note that it isn't just fans on TikTok that are <strong>drawing attention to Sprouse and Palvin's looks</strong>. One example of that is that a post on a pop culture subreddit about Sprouse and Palvin getting engaged included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responses focused on their looks</a>.</p><p>One Reddit response to the news reads, "I mean this more of a joke, but they look so much alike and you know what they say about couples that look alike 😂" If that wasn't amazing enough, one responder disputed that Sprouse and Palvin looked alike.
